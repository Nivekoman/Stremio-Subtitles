1
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:36,600
Will you marry me?

2
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:38,058
Kabir... please.

3
00:01:38,434 --> 00:01:39,392
Okay.

4
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:42,058
Will you marry me, please?

5
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:44,392
Why are you doing this?

6
00:01:45,309 --> 00:01:47,183
Because sooner or later we will.

7
00:01:48,518 --> 00:01:49,725
We love each other.

8
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:52,725
Our families seem to
tolerate each other.

9
00:01:53,809 --> 00:01:56,767
I'm an architect and you're
an interior designer.

10
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,560
We're perfect.

11
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:03,060
What do you say?

12
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:05,519
Are you sure?

13
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:08,519
Natasha, please make it quick...

14
00:02:08,603 --> 00:02:09,269
my knee is hurting.

15
00:02:11,395 --> 00:02:12,352
Yes!

16
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:34,852
It seems like only yesterday that
Natasha came into this world.

17
00:02:35,395 --> 00:02:36,560
And today she's getting engaged.

18
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,311
Kabir, I'm not losing a daughter.

19
00:02:41,396 --> 00:02:42,811
I'm gaining a son.

20
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:44,562
You're so filmy, dad.

21
00:02:48,397 --> 00:02:49,396
Excuse me!

22
00:02:49,397 --> 00:02:50,104
Harryji

23
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:55,437
Two years ago you commissioned
me to build your hotel.

24
00:02:56,438 --> 00:02:59,312
Who would've imagined that
one day we'll be a big family.

25
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:02,729
On behaIf of my family,
I welcome you all.

26
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:04,146
Thank you so much.

27
00:03:04,688 --> 00:03:08,187
Did you ever know that you're my hero

28
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:12,521
You're everything I wish I could be

29
00:03:13,855 --> 00:03:17,104
I can fly like an eagle

30
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,522
Cause you're the wind beneath my wings

31
00:03:23,898 --> 00:03:29,731
You're the wind beneath my wings

32
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,564
- That was lovely.

33
00:03:36,565 --> 00:03:37,564
Wonderful.

34
00:03:41,232 --> 00:03:42,064
Hello everyone.

35
00:03:42,065 --> 00:03:43,273
I am Imran.

36
00:03:43,982 --> 00:03:45,398
Kabir and I have been
friends since school.

37
00:03:45,649 --> 00:03:46,939
The three Musketeers!

38
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:50,148
That's right, it was the name
uncle had given the three of us.

39
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:51,439
The three Musketeers.

40
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,523
Unfortunately, the third musketeer...

41
00:03:54,524 --> 00:03:56,523
Arjun is not with us anymore.

42
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:01,398
Don't worry, he's alive. He
just isn't here right now.

43
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:04,399
Anyway, Natasha...

44
00:04:04,775 --> 00:04:07,524
Kabir is one of the nicest guys ever.

45
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:11,065
So, if you ever smash
his BMW, don't worry.

46
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:13,483
Good excuse to get a new car.
- Absolutely.

47
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:17,358
He's also very intelligent.

48
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,733
So leave the kid's homework to him.

49
00:04:21,317 --> 00:04:22,483
You're a true friend, thanks.

50
00:04:22,484 --> 00:04:23,441
You're welcome, bro.

51
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:26,483
He's very large hearted.

52
00:04:27,026 --> 00:04:28,858
So, don't think twice...

53
00:04:28,859 --> 00:04:30,233
just buy those diamonds.

54
00:04:30,234 --> 00:04:31,358
Okay.

55
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,233
Basically Natasha...

56
00:04:38,776 --> 00:04:40,775
Kabir is a solid guy.

57
00:04:41,817 --> 00:04:44,316
Put your hand in his and walk with him.

58
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:46,942
Because no matter what...

59
00:04:47,277 --> 00:04:48,442
he will never let you down.

60
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:50,776
- So sweet.
- Hear, hear!

61
00:04:53,443 --> 00:04:54,401
Thank you.

62
00:04:54,485 --> 00:04:55,609
You can send the cheque now.

63
00:04:57,485 --> 00:04:58,360
Tanya...

64
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:00,360
thank you.

65
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,568
Let me warn you...

66
00:05:02,778 --> 00:05:05,277
Nikhil is planning a full
power bachelor party.

67
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:06,402
Too late.

68
00:05:06,403 --> 00:05:09,277
His school friends have
planned a bachelor holiday.

69
00:05:09,403 --> 00:05:10,402
A road trip...

70
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:11,443
through Spain.

71
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:13,860
- A road trip?
- Don't ask.

72
00:05:14,403 --> 00:05:16,777
They had made some
pact in college that...

73
00:05:16,778 --> 00:05:19,860
each one would choose
an adventure sport...

74
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,902
Are you serious?
Like Fear Factor?

75
00:05:22,528 --> 00:05:23,527
Exactly!

76
00:05:23,611 --> 00:05:25,985
And the other two would have to do it.

77
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:27,902
So, what have you picked?

78
00:05:28,403 --> 00:05:29,861
That I can't say.

79
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,569
Not in front of me, at least.

80
00:05:33,695 --> 00:05:34,569
You see...

81
00:05:34,654 --> 00:05:37,944
the sport we pick is a
surprise for the other two.

82
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:39,528
Shut up!

83
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,028
- Seriously.
- Are you kidding me?

84
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:42,487
No.

85
00:05:42,613 --> 00:05:45,487
That ensures none of us back out.

86
00:05:46,488 --> 00:05:48,070
Whose idea was this?

87
00:05:48,488 --> 00:05:49,279
Mine.

88
00:05:49,988 --> 00:05:50,612
Three weeks.

89
00:05:50,863 --> 00:05:52,279
You know how these boys are.

90
00:05:52,696 --> 00:05:53,320
Not Kabir.

91
00:05:54,113 --> 00:05:55,320
Oh please!

92
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,195
All guys go crazy at bachelor parties.

93
00:05:59,321 --> 00:06:00,404
In fact...

94
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:05,320
Nikhil still hasn't told me
what happened at his.

95
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:07,445
I don't know.

96
00:06:08,488 --> 00:06:10,945
I heard something
about your bachelor party.

97
00:06:16,489 --> 00:06:17,530
Who told you?

98
00:06:17,656 --> 00:06:18,613
So it is true.

99
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:20,488
Does Natasha know?

100
00:06:21,489 --> 00:06:22,696
No man, why would I tell her?

101
00:06:23,114 --> 00:06:24,446
Please... don't tell her.

102
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:27,364
She was from Ukraine.

103
00:06:28,698 --> 00:06:30,114
- Bloody hot!
- Nice.

104
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:31,447
I was sloshed.

105
00:06:32,907 --> 00:06:33,947
Okay, listen...

106
00:06:34,407 --> 00:06:36,781
If Sameera finds out about
this, she'll kill me.

107
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,739
I know, don't worry.

108
00:06:38,823 --> 00:06:42,031
It was my last night as a bachelor.
You know I'd never do it otherwise.

109
00:06:42,032 --> 00:06:44,072
I understand, don't worry about it.

110
00:06:44,073 --> 00:06:45,072
- Please.
- It happens.

111
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,531
Sameera!

112
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:52,239
Sorry, I couldn't resist.

113
00:06:53,073 --> 00:06:54,907
- Take care, man.
- See you.

114
00:06:57,866 --> 00:07:00,615
Trust me, this trick never fails.

115
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,698
What do you mean?

116
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:07,365
Well, you tell people you
know something about them...

117
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:10,448
and before you know it,
they tell you their secrets.

118
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:11,865
Shut up!

119
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:14,116
You didn't know about the Ukrainian?

120
00:07:14,617 --> 00:07:15,824
No, he just told me.

121
00:07:17,242 --> 00:07:18,824
Mind blowing!

122
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:24,033
- Yeah, well time equals money, Simon.
You want money, stop wasting my time.

123
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,574
Sell 50,000 June contracts!

124
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:28,949
50,000 and don't screw up
my stop losses this time!

125
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,991
How much?

126
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,408
Damn! That's horrendous!

127
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:35,616
Sell it. Sell everything.

128
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:45,450
Listen Joe, if you continue to
give me bullshit fills like that...

129
00:07:45,451 --> 00:07:47,617
I'm going to have to trade my
Ferrari in for a Ford Fiesta!

130
00:07:48,118 --> 00:07:49,450
He doesn't like pink.

131
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,617
We have white and gold and...

132
00:07:53,243 --> 00:07:54,534
tonnes of champagne.

133
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,700
And...

134
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:58,076
- the centre piece.
- This is Nice.

135
00:07:59,077 --> 00:07:59,951
Finally!

136
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:01,243
Kabira!

137
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:03,285
Sorry man.

138
00:08:03,411 --> 00:08:05,076
You have no idea what's happening here.

139
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:07,493
And you have no idea what
a nice party you missed.

140
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:09,451
I'm sure, man.

141
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:11,076
Listen...

142
00:08:11,411 --> 00:08:12,701
I've a problem.

143
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,035
I can't make it to Spain.

144
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:15,451
- What?!

145
00:08:16,786 --> 00:08:18,410
Arjun, you promised!

146
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:20,119
I know but...

147
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,161
I thought this deal I'm working
on would come through...

148
00:08:23,328 --> 00:08:23,911
- but I'm stuck.

149
00:08:24,412 --> 00:08:27,411
I can't believe you're ditching
me on my bachelor trip.

150
00:08:28,412 --> 00:08:29,536
It's not that...

151
00:08:29,537 --> 00:08:30,994
- Then what is it?

152
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:33,661
We had decided to do this together.

153
00:08:35,412 --> 00:08:37,869
If you can't make it,
I'm calling it off.

154
00:08:38,287 --> 00:08:40,577
Don't get sentimental.
It's my work!

155
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,287
I'm not.

156
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,120
It's been cancelled once
before, so let's do it again.

157
00:08:45,121 --> 00:08:46,495
It's fine.

158
00:08:47,704 --> 00:08:51,287
It's either the three of
us going or none at all.

159
00:09:15,414 --> 00:09:16,496
Hey...

160
00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:18,121
Hi.

161
00:09:18,414 --> 00:09:18,996
How are you?

162
00:09:19,622 --> 00:09:20,454
Good.

163
00:09:21,705 --> 00:09:23,663
Looking good, you've been working out?

164
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:24,788
Yes.

165
00:09:25,455 --> 00:09:26,829
I usually come in the morning.

166
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:33,997
I was going to call you.

167
00:09:34,873 --> 00:09:35,872
Then why didn't you?

168
00:09:37,623 --> 00:09:38,789
I'm getting married.

169
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:45,456
- That was quick.
- Arjun, please!

170
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:51,790
All the best, Rohini.

171
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:11,415
- Arjun, it's me again.

172
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,707
- Don't ditch me.

173
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,291
- I know why you're making excuses.

174
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,874
- But it's been four
years for that incident.

175
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:19,832
- I'm getting married now.

176
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,124
- Even today, I only have two friends.

177
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:27,458
- We're the three Musketeers.
All for one, one for all.

178
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:35,167
Have you thought about...

179
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:37,500
what we spoke?

180
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:38,792
About what?

181
00:10:40,543 --> 00:10:43,458
Are you moving back to Bombay?

182
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:45,208
Ammi...

183
00:10:46,043 --> 00:10:49,000
I like Delhi and living on my own.

184
00:10:55,626 --> 00:10:58,501
And this trip to Spain...

185
00:10:58,502 --> 00:11:01,334
is it a coincidence or did you plan it?

186
00:11:03,627 --> 00:11:05,876
Why don't you just say
what you're really thinking?

187
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:08,459
Fine.

188
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,210
Do you intend to meet Salman?

189
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:13,919
I don't know.

190
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,960
Imran, why don't you trust me?

191
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:18,502
It's not about you Ammi.

192
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:20,710
- He is my father.
- He's your father?

193
00:11:20,711 --> 00:11:25,919
Has he ever called you or
tried to find out how you are?

194
00:11:26,003 --> 00:11:28,002
Maybe he did and you kept it from me.

195
00:11:29,628 --> 00:11:31,835
Until recently I wasn't even
aware that he is my father.

196
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:34,335
Alright.

197
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,002
Do what you want.

198
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:38,419
But please remember this.

199
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,460
Faisal was your only father.

200
00:11:46,504 --> 00:11:48,670
- Hello there.
- Hello.

201
00:11:49,212 --> 00:11:50,628
I can see you.

202
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:52,629
I miss you, baby.

203
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,212
Now we can see each other everyday.

204
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:57,879
I'm only going for three weeks, Natasha.

205
00:12:06,588 --> 00:12:08,962
What will I do in London all alone?

206
00:12:09,505 --> 00:12:11,504
You'll shop.

207
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:15,754
And in three weeks I'll come to
London to carry your shopping bags.

208
00:12:15,838 --> 00:12:17,837
- Very funny.
- I know.

209
00:15:55,848 --> 00:15:57,389
Thank you.

210
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,722
So how many miles are we driving?
- We're on road for three weeks.

211
00:16:00,807 --> 00:16:02,889
- I don't see Madrid in this plan.
- Because it's not there.

212
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,722
- We travel to Spain but we're
not going to see the capital?

213
00:16:04,807 --> 00:16:06,889
- We don't have enough time.

214
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,515
- We can't change it now.
- I think we should.

215
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:10,015
Look who's here!

216
00:16:11,434 --> 00:16:13,641
- Welcome! How was your flight?
- Hello.

217
00:16:14,434 --> 00:16:15,724
Well...

218
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:16,974
it flew.

219
00:16:17,517 --> 00:16:18,474
Funny!

220
00:16:27,225 --> 00:16:29,683
- Good to see you.
- You too.

221
00:16:29,684 --> 00:16:30,766
I'm sorry about Abu.

222
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,391
I got your email.

223
00:16:34,517 --> 00:16:36,141
- How's Ammi?
- She's fine.

224
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,891
It's not easy to get over these things.

225
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:41,433
How've you been?

226
00:16:41,642 --> 00:16:42,516
I'm good.

227
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,016
Pretty good actually.

228
00:16:44,017 --> 00:16:46,183
I've a new apartment.
Three bedrooms, big space.

229
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,849
Nice.

230
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,225
I can't believe we're together again.

231
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:51,850
- Yeah.
- Finally!

232
00:16:52,351 --> 00:16:53,184
Should we sit?

233
00:16:54,268 --> 00:16:56,060
So, here is the plan.

234
00:16:56,436 --> 00:16:57,685
First...

235
00:16:57,686 --> 00:17:00,393
we go to Costa Brava,
which is my choice.

236
00:17:01,227 --> 00:17:02,893
Then Arjun wants to go to Seville.

237
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:04,935
And then we'll head to... Sevia.

238
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:06,435
Pampalona which you've chosen.

239
00:17:06,436 --> 00:17:08,685
Tomorrow morning we
leave for Costa Brava.

240
00:17:15,352 --> 00:17:16,643
What are you doing with the laptop?

241
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:18,518
I'm looking for an address.

242
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:19,643
Hola Kabira.

243
00:17:23,102 --> 00:17:24,476
Kabira...
- Yes.

244
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:26,060
Your treasure.

245
00:17:27,352 --> 00:17:28,935
Brilliant. Thanks a ton.

246
00:17:33,228 --> 00:17:34,811
What have you done to this?

247
00:17:35,312 --> 00:17:36,394
Dude!

248
00:17:36,478 --> 00:17:40,061
First of all, be thankful that I
bought this 12,000 Euro bag for you!

249
00:17:40,062 --> 00:17:40,937
What?

250
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:43,103
Here... show, show...

251
00:17:47,604 --> 00:17:49,645
12,000 Euro for this purse?
- Yes.

252
00:17:50,021 --> 00:17:51,437
Way more than your salary.

253
00:17:54,688 --> 00:17:55,395
What?

254
00:17:56,604 --> 00:17:57,978
Natasha loves these bags.

255
00:17:58,563 --> 00:17:59,562
And I love cars, Kabir.

256
00:18:00,563 --> 00:18:01,520
Always remember.

257
00:18:01,646 --> 00:18:03,687
If you ever want to gift
me an expensive car...

258
00:18:03,813 --> 00:18:05,645
don't hesitate.

259
00:18:05,646 --> 00:18:06,937
I won't.

260
00:18:06,938 --> 00:18:07,437
Good.

261
00:18:07,438 --> 00:18:08,437
Let's go.

262
00:18:08,438 --> 00:18:09,853
I can't.

263
00:18:10,521 --> 00:18:12,562
I need to make some calls.

264
00:18:12,563 --> 00:18:13,312
I'll see you guys later.

265
00:18:14,605 --> 00:18:16,063
Adios amigos.

266
00:18:17,272 --> 00:18:19,521
- I thought this was a holiday.
- Me too.

267
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:21,729
Let's go.

268
00:18:22,064 --> 00:18:23,021
We take the next right.

269
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,564
- Looks quite old.
- There it is.

270
00:18:32,523 --> 00:18:33,689
There is the cathedral.

271
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:37,189
- Do you know where this place is?
- Yes, straight ahead.

272
00:18:37,481 --> 00:18:39,064
How far is this gallery?

273
00:18:39,898 --> 00:18:40,855
Shut up!

274
00:18:41,273 --> 00:18:42,647
It's just here.

275
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:45,480
This is the street.
Catonia... whatever.

276
00:18:47,523 --> 00:18:48,772
And that's the place.

277
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:50,064
I guess.

278
00:19:01,816 --> 00:19:03,065
Hey!

279
00:19:07,107 --> 00:19:08,523
Salman Habib.

280
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:09,856
It's a desi name.

281
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,524
He must be Pakistani or Indian.

282
00:19:28,442 --> 00:19:29,191
Thanks.

283
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:35,232
I wish you'd come with us.

284
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:37,441
We walked all over
looking for his gallery.

285
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:39,566
Man, this city is beautiful.

286
00:19:39,693 --> 00:19:42,692
Well, today I made a 2,000
Pound commission, so...

287
00:19:42,818 --> 00:19:44,275
excuse me if I don't complain.

288
00:19:44,943 --> 00:19:45,608
Cheers.

289
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:47,275
- 2,000 Pounds?
- Yup!

290
00:19:47,484 --> 00:19:48,067
Cheers.

291
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,567
Dude...

292
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,443
I heard something about you.

293
00:19:56,694 --> 00:19:57,568
What?

294
00:19:59,694 --> 00:20:00,776
You know what it is.

295
00:20:02,694 --> 00:20:03,484
Mom told you?

296
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:07,484
Yes.

297
00:20:09,527 --> 00:20:11,901
But did she tell you I was forced?

298
00:20:12,235 --> 00:20:13,651
- Okay?
- Okay.

299
00:20:15,235 --> 00:20:17,193
God man! She can't keep
anything to herseIf.

300
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,359
She's driving me crazy, man.

301
00:20:20,027 --> 00:20:20,651
Yeah.

302
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,485
She came to London a few days ago.

303
00:20:22,486 --> 00:20:24,444
And dragged me to some
friend's relative's place.

304
00:20:24,445 --> 00:20:25,485
To see a girl.

305
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,985
Neelu aunty and Gogi
uncle's daughter Cookie.

306
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:32,235
I'd decided that I'd
go, have some tea...

307
00:20:32,486 --> 00:20:35,319
exchange pleasantries
and decline the match.

308
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,485
As I took the first sip...

309
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:39,777
Cookie said 'no'!

310
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:41,486
So... you know...

311
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:42,653
What?!

312
00:20:42,654 --> 00:20:44,486
I mean, so what! What is there?

313
00:20:49,821 --> 00:20:50,653
What?

314
00:20:53,446 --> 00:20:54,778
Come on, man!

315
00:20:56,112 --> 00:20:58,403
You were set up for an
arranged marriage...

316
00:20:58,487 --> 00:20:59,528
and you got rejected?

317
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:01,945
But I didn't even try
to create an impression.

318
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:03,861
- Now you're just saying it.
- I didn't want to impress her!

319
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,279
You've ruined our reputation.

320
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,154
Shut up, please stop it!

321
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,821
Why did she have to tell
you? What's wrong with her?

322
00:21:12,655 --> 00:21:15,071
Actually, your mom said nothing.

323
00:21:15,072 --> 00:21:18,446
It's his latest trick. And
you're his latest victim.

324
00:21:18,447 --> 00:21:19,446
- Cheers!

325
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:21,612
2,000 Pounds!

326
00:21:25,364 --> 00:21:27,655
He's failed.
- Grow up, man!

327
00:21:28,823 --> 00:21:30,322
How old are you?

328
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:32,780
You know what...

329
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:34,738
we have to have some shots.

330
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:37,155
- One for Cookie.
- We'll raise a toast to Cookie.

331
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:38,322
Okay.

332
00:21:40,073 --> 00:21:41,655
Not for me.

333
00:21:41,656 --> 00:21:43,280
I have a conference call in an hour.

334
00:21:43,531 --> 00:21:45,238
Same old plan?

335
00:21:45,323 --> 00:21:46,863
Mint money and retire at 40?

336
00:21:47,324 --> 00:21:48,364
Yup!

337
00:21:48,449 --> 00:21:49,323
That's the plan.

338
00:21:59,949 --> 00:22:01,739
Listen...

339
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,781
thank you.

340
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:04,614
For what?

341
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,406
For coming on this trip.
It means a lot to me.

342
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,532
I'm sure it does.

343
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:20,449
Literacy is the key.

344
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,240
It's not that simple.

345
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:26,032
Oh - my - God!

346
00:22:31,534 --> 00:22:34,450
Kabira, amazing choice.

347
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:37,616
She's gorgeous but she isn't ours.

348
00:22:38,451 --> 00:22:39,450
What?

349
00:22:40,242 --> 00:22:41,700
An SUV will be a lot comfortable.

350
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:45,325
To hell with the comfort.
Just look at her!

351
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,366
Guys?

352
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:54,366
- Hola, good morning. Your name?

353
00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:55,326
- Kabir Dewan.
- Guys!

354
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,784
Kabir... Arjun...

355
00:22:58,452 --> 00:22:59,659
She's beautiful.

356
00:23:02,868 --> 00:23:05,826
I've booked an SUV and
they've charged me, sorry.

357
00:23:06,535 --> 00:23:07,992
Sell Natasha's purse.

358
00:23:09,327 --> 00:23:10,284
Funny.

359
00:23:10,868 --> 00:23:12,117
Please!

360
00:23:12,494 --> 00:23:15,077
What are you doing?
Behave yourseIf!

361
00:23:17,244 --> 00:23:19,243
Oh, don't even think about it, dude.

362
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:22,452
All my life I sat in your car.

363
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:25,243
Now it's my turn.

364
00:23:27,828 --> 00:23:29,702
What are you doing?

365
00:23:29,703 --> 00:23:32,202
12,000 Euro. She rides first class.

366
00:24:35,956 --> 00:24:38,706
Hey Sarah, what's up?
Mr. Yamamoto called?

367
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,622
Well, he'll have the docket in two days.

368
00:24:43,873 --> 00:24:47,164
No, no don't say I'm on a holiday.
Just get Joe to call me back. Bye.

369
00:24:53,082 --> 00:24:54,456
Hey Joe, what's up?

370
00:24:55,457 --> 00:24:56,914
Like... 'now' now?

371
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:02,581
Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'll do it, bye.

372
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:11,957
Sorry guys.

373
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:29,249
Guys... ten minutes tops!

374
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:32,916
Moshi moshi, Arjun-san.

375
00:25:33,584 --> 00:25:35,333
Moshi moshi, Yamamoto-san.

376
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:39,291
How are you?

377
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:40,916
I'm fine, thank you.

378
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,499
Moshi, moshi?

379
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:45,916
It's Japanese for hello.

380
00:25:46,292 --> 00:25:48,499
- I assure you, I will
always be here for you.

381
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:53,583
Kabira...

382
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:55,292
look at this amazing view.

383
00:25:56,168 --> 00:25:57,792
And, now look at our friend.

384
00:25:58,543 --> 00:26:00,542
My team is going to put
together all the information.

385
00:26:00,543 --> 00:26:02,000
And you will have the docket
with you in three days.

386
00:26:03,711 --> 00:26:04,710
What happened to him, dude?

387
00:26:06,711 --> 00:26:08,376
If you ask me...

388
00:26:08,461 --> 00:26:10,251
he has become mentally sick.

389
00:26:11,127 --> 00:26:13,585
And he needs the psychiatrist.

390
00:26:15,252 --> 00:26:16,501
Isn't this from school?

391
00:26:16,711 --> 00:26:18,001
Not school.

392
00:26:18,127 --> 00:26:20,460
- Eschool!
- Eschool.

393
00:26:20,836 --> 00:26:21,501
Eschool!

394
00:26:21,502 --> 00:26:25,001
Because only the Mr. The
Dubey can the talk like this.

395
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:27,543
The Mr. The Dubey.

396
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:32,001
Are you mentally challenged my buy?

397
00:26:33,544 --> 00:26:34,501
Not buy.

398
00:26:36,044 --> 00:26:36,835
Bwoy.

399
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:39,043
- Bwoy.

400
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:40,919
Mentally challenged my bwoy...

401
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,919
Mental bwoy.

402
00:26:44,045 --> 00:26:44,920
Thank you, Mr. Yamamoto.

403
00:26:47,629 --> 00:26:49,545
Let's go. I'm done.

404
00:26:49,629 --> 00:26:50,712
Arjun, my bwoy...

405
00:26:51,379 --> 00:26:54,170
you look the mental in this the uniform!

406
00:26:56,046 --> 00:26:56,878
Let's go.

407
00:26:58,088 --> 00:27:00,253
Okay, the very the well the saids.

408
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,338
Guys...

409
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:28,089
just do as I say.

410
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:31,922
It's been ten years since
college. Please grow up.

411
00:27:31,923 --> 00:27:34,464
- Don't do this, please.
- Trust me.

412
00:27:34,465 --> 00:27:36,589
You'll kiss me later.

413
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:38,714
When I shout...

414
00:27:38,715 --> 00:27:41,964
point to the urinal and scream loudly.

415
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:02,130
Bye!

416
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,924
Dude, you're the mentally the sick!

417
00:28:12,383 --> 00:28:14,841
People are the same everywhere.

418
00:28:14,925 --> 00:28:16,549
It's just human nature.

419
00:28:22,383 --> 00:28:23,007
What are you doing?

420
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,132
Poor thing's feeling hot.

421
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:29,632
Poor thing?

422
00:28:29,717 --> 00:28:31,007
Kabira...

423
00:28:32,092 --> 00:28:34,424
meet Bagwati.

424
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:39,257
What's happened to your jokes?

425
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,674
Are they sick?

426
00:28:41,467 --> 00:28:44,466
Well, they've taken after you.

427
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,174
Hey Joe, yes I spoke
to Mr. Yamamoto and...

428
00:28:47,883 --> 00:28:49,924
Somebody please throw his phone out.

429
00:28:52,551 --> 00:28:53,550
What the...

430
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,718
- Are you mad?

431
00:28:58,927 --> 00:28:59,926
Did you just...

432
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:12,634
You think we'll get it?

433
00:29:16,677 --> 00:29:19,551
Sorry, I didn't think he would do it.

434
00:29:19,552 --> 00:29:21,176
Of course you didn't know, Kabir.

435
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:23,509
Now go find my phone.

436
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,801
- Where?
- I don't know.

437
00:29:24,885 --> 00:29:26,259
I want my phone, that's all.

438
00:29:26,594 --> 00:29:27,384
It could've broken.

439
00:29:27,385 --> 00:29:29,468
Arjun, don't be silly...
we won't find it.

440
00:29:29,469 --> 00:29:30,509
Silly?

441
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,259
You threw my phone out of
a moving car, you moron!

442
00:29:33,969 --> 00:29:36,219
He said it, I threw it.

443
00:29:36,303 --> 00:29:36,677
Didn't you?

444
00:29:36,928 --> 00:29:38,385
Kabir...

445
00:29:38,511 --> 00:29:39,928
please tell me to slap him.

446
00:29:40,054 --> 00:29:40,928
Don't be silly.

447
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:43,511
Just tell me to slap him.

448
00:29:44,304 --> 00:29:45,053
Slap him.

449
00:29:48,096 --> 00:29:48,845
- What's wrong with you?
- Guys!

450
00:29:49,762 --> 00:29:51,595
I'll get you a new phone.
I was just joking.

451
00:29:51,762 --> 00:29:53,595
Well, it's not funny.

452
00:29:53,596 --> 00:29:55,136
That call was important.

453
00:29:55,846 --> 00:29:59,136
You think being 'cool and funny'
gives you the license to do anything?

454
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,636
It's always like, 'Imran
said this. He's so funny.'

455
00:30:01,637 --> 00:30:03,595
'Imran did that, he is so cool'.

456
00:30:03,596 --> 00:30:04,761
Grow up!

457
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,761
Throwing my phone out
the window is not funny!

458
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:10,220
Hooking up with my
girIfriend was not funny!

459
00:30:16,096 --> 00:30:17,053
Listen...

460
00:30:17,472 --> 00:30:19,137
it's been four years.

461
00:30:19,263 --> 00:30:20,721
And I've apologised for it.

462
00:30:20,722 --> 00:30:22,429
Now let it go.

463
00:30:22,972 --> 00:30:24,472
Or what? Huh, what?

464
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:26,847
Stop it. Stop it, you two.

465
00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:29,722
You're behaving like kids.

466
00:30:32,139 --> 00:30:33,597
If there's a problem, deal with it.

467
00:30:33,681 --> 00:30:34,472
Like aduIts.

468
00:30:34,681 --> 00:30:35,888
Who made you the judge?

469
00:30:36,306 --> 00:30:37,388
Do you see anyone else here?

470
00:30:37,389 --> 00:30:38,055
Listen.

471
00:30:38,473 --> 00:30:39,930
Let's get this straight.

472
00:30:39,931 --> 00:30:41,138
I don't have any problem with him.

473
00:30:42,848 --> 00:30:44,930
Why would you have a problem?

474
00:30:44,931 --> 00:30:46,388
Sonali was my girIfriend.

475
00:30:46,556 --> 00:30:48,222
Come on, Sonali and me fell in love.

476
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:50,972
It happens. Shit happens.

477
00:30:51,889 --> 00:30:52,388
Yeah.

478
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:54,430
It was shit.

479
00:30:55,514 --> 00:30:56,263
For me.

480
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:59,597
And I'm sure you didn't
give it a second thought.

481
00:31:01,849 --> 00:31:03,056
Imran man...

482
00:31:04,182 --> 00:31:06,264
I would never do that to you.

483
00:31:06,682 --> 00:31:07,431
Arjun...

484
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,140
I screwed up. Now what
do you want me to do?

485
00:31:10,641 --> 00:31:11,474
What do I do?

486
00:31:11,475 --> 00:31:12,890
Should I wear a 'Sorry, Arjun'
t-shirt and walk around?

487
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:13,890
What should I do?

488
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,182
Just look at him.

489
00:31:17,683 --> 00:31:18,890
Listen to me, okay.
You two, please!

490
00:31:19,516 --> 00:31:20,474
Sonali was a bitch.

491
00:31:21,475 --> 00:31:22,099
Understand?

492
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,515
I'm sorry, really.

493
00:31:23,766 --> 00:31:25,432
She used you.

494
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:26,807
Then gave you a BPL and used him.

495
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,515
And she dumped you as well.

496
00:31:29,266 --> 00:31:31,599
She was a waste of time then
and she is a waste of time now.

497
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,765
Four years ago we cancelled
this trip because of her.

498
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,849
Today we're here for me.
Don't let her ruin this.

499
00:31:39,141 --> 00:31:39,974
Please!

500
00:31:41,725 --> 00:31:43,350
How many times do I have to apologise?

501
00:31:44,851 --> 00:31:46,683
How many times?
Let's just make it clear.

502
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,891
Till it doesn't come from here.

503
00:31:57,893 --> 00:31:58,892
What's BPL?

504
00:31:59,852 --> 00:32:00,684
Bum Pe Laat.
[Kick in the arse.]

505
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,101
You're crazy.

506
00:32:09,102 --> 00:32:11,517
Speak with him. He slapped me.

507
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:13,809
Get married.
- What!

508
00:32:13,893 --> 00:32:14,976
I can't believe this.

509
00:32:28,561 --> 00:32:30,018
Hi baby...

510
00:32:31,144 --> 00:32:31,810
Good.

511
00:32:32,936 --> 00:32:34,602
We've left Barcelona.

512
00:32:35,728 --> 00:32:37,102
On the road.

513
00:32:37,978 --> 00:32:39,644
Yes, it's beautiful.

514
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:43,728
Of course, they're with me.
Where will they go?

515
00:32:45,937 --> 00:32:47,394
Everything is cool.

516
00:32:49,604 --> 00:32:50,561
Yeah.

517
00:33:07,688 --> 00:33:09,562
All ready.

518
00:33:09,563 --> 00:33:10,687
Come on.

519
00:33:13,188 --> 00:33:14,270
Yes!

520
00:33:14,355 --> 00:33:15,770
Now this is a house.

521
00:33:15,771 --> 00:33:17,479
- I like.
- Cool.

522
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,729
It's lovely.

523
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,604
You haven't seen the haIf of it yet.

524
00:33:22,396 --> 00:33:23,438
Can we slide?

525
00:33:23,772 --> 00:33:24,646
No, you can't.

526
00:33:25,397 --> 00:33:26,605
- Captain.
- Amazing.

527
00:33:26,606 --> 00:33:27,771
Wow, man!

528
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:30,188
This is nicer than the pictures.

529
00:33:35,731 --> 00:33:36,563
Amazing.

530
00:33:36,564 --> 00:33:37,521
What a view!

531
00:33:41,731 --> 00:33:42,938
Someday.

532
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,690
How was it?

533
00:34:29,691 --> 00:34:30,482
Refreshing.

534
00:34:32,984 --> 00:34:34,649
Who is she?

535
00:34:34,734 --> 00:34:35,899
How should I know, dude?

536
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:39,441
She's nice.

537
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:42,274
Really nice.

538
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:46,316
What's happening?

539
00:34:47,192 --> 00:34:48,774
She's got me. She's
pulling me towards her.

540
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,274
She's pulling me.

541
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,566
I saw her first.

542
00:34:54,151 --> 00:34:55,234
So true.

543
00:34:56,526 --> 00:34:59,109
But has she seen you?

544
00:35:01,985 --> 00:35:02,609
What?

545
00:35:04,526 --> 00:35:06,942
- Hola.
- Hola.

546
00:35:08,401 --> 00:35:08,984
Can I try that?

547
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:11,317
Yeah.

548
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,567
Thanks.

549
00:35:17,527 --> 00:35:18,901
Where are you from?

550
00:35:18,902 --> 00:35:19,568
Brazil?

551
00:35:20,861 --> 00:35:22,151
HaIf US, haIf India.

552
00:35:22,777 --> 00:35:23,651
India?

553
00:35:24,944 --> 00:35:26,526
What a coincidence!
Which part?

554
00:35:27,194 --> 00:35:29,485
My dad's from Delhi
but I live in London.

555
00:35:30,694 --> 00:35:32,151
Hindi? Not bad!

556
00:35:32,694 --> 00:35:34,693
You too... wow!

557
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:40,694
If you're free, want
to join me for a drink?

558
00:35:46,153 --> 00:35:47,111
I have an early morning.

559
00:35:48,362 --> 00:35:49,194
Sorry.

560
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,027
Thanks.

561
00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:06,195
Bye.

562
00:36:10,571 --> 00:36:12,237
What's your name?

563
00:36:12,321 --> 00:36:13,070
Laila.

564
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,320
Imran.

565
00:36:14,988 --> 00:36:17,612
But my friends call me 'Romeo'.

566
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,988
Romeo?

567
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:33,363
Seriously man... Romeo?

568
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:35,988
I mean, chee!

569
00:36:36,614 --> 00:36:37,238
Arjun...

570
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:40,364
It's a man's duty to try.

571
00:36:41,156 --> 00:36:43,780
Success and failure are in His hands.

572
00:36:44,198 --> 00:36:45,780
Great, professor.

573
00:36:47,531 --> 00:36:48,739
Seriously?

574
00:36:49,115 --> 00:36:50,864
You got me this time!

575
00:37:01,865 --> 00:37:02,530
What the hell is this?

576
00:37:03,656 --> 00:37:04,655
What?

577
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:09,615
This! What the hell is this?

578
00:37:09,866 --> 00:37:12,115
You said I had to get you a new phone.

579
00:37:12,116 --> 00:37:13,365
You didn't specify which one.

580
00:37:13,866 --> 00:37:15,323
I'm a trader.

581
00:37:15,324 --> 00:37:16,573
Not a Japanese school girl.

582
00:37:17,491 --> 00:37:18,281
Moshi moshi.

583
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:21,490
Shut up, just shut up!

584
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:24,324
- Just don't talk to me.
- Guys that's enough!

585
00:37:25,283 --> 00:37:27,282
Look at this. What's wrong with him?

586
00:37:28,408 --> 00:37:29,282
What's wrong with you?

587
00:37:29,492 --> 00:37:30,949
It's funny.

588
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:33,282
Anyway, now listen.

589
00:37:33,283 --> 00:37:34,824
Why we are here in Costa Brava.

590
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:36,991
Ready for this?

591
00:37:37,908 --> 00:37:38,407
Yeah.

592
00:37:41,117 --> 00:37:42,366
Deep... sea...

593
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:43,657
diving.

594
00:37:45,492 --> 00:37:46,324
What?

595
00:37:47,117 --> 00:37:49,324
Yes, our training begins
first thing tomorrow.

596
00:37:49,908 --> 00:37:51,491
I'm sorry but...

597
00:37:51,492 --> 00:37:53,700
why is this turning into a
'Let's-torture-Arjun' holiday?

598
00:37:53,701 --> 00:37:55,158
I just don't understand.

599
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,742
Relax, I know.

600
00:37:56,743 --> 00:37:58,617
I spoke with the people
at the diving school.

601
00:37:58,701 --> 00:38:00,742
You don't need to know how to swim.

602
00:38:00,743 --> 00:38:02,575
At least you know how to drown.

603
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:05,159
Listen, just keep quiet. Just...

604
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,326
keep quiet.

605
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:08,034
Kabir...

606
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:10,576
I don't understand how
you thought I'll do this.

607
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:11,868
What's wrong with you?

608
00:38:19,285 --> 00:38:20,534
Bathroom... to the left.

609
00:38:28,577 --> 00:38:29,576
Okay, listen.

610
00:38:29,952 --> 00:38:32,659
I know you're scared of water.

611
00:38:32,702 --> 00:38:33,076
Okay.

612
00:38:33,535 --> 00:38:36,534
But then that's the challenge.
And it's completely safe.

613
00:38:36,869 --> 00:38:38,327
Think about it.

614
00:38:38,328 --> 00:38:39,744
Blue waters... okay?

615
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,660
Fish swimming close to you.

616
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:43,494
Corals...

617
00:38:45,078 --> 00:38:46,119
It'll be amazing.

618
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:53,578
Look, if you're not comfortable,
no one's going to force you.

619
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:56,578
No, I'm serious, it's okay.

620
00:38:57,121 --> 00:38:58,536
Okay. Fine.

621
00:39:11,704 --> 00:39:12,120
Kabir Dewan?

622
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:15,203
Laila?

623
00:39:15,204 --> 00:39:15,536
Hey.

624
00:39:15,662 --> 00:39:17,161
Hi, what are you doing here?

625
00:39:17,704 --> 00:39:19,370
Following you, I guess.

626
00:39:20,162 --> 00:39:20,953
Really?

627
00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:22,621
No.

628
00:39:23,163 --> 00:39:25,037
I'm here to train you.

629
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,162
I'm an instructor here.

630
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,454
Wow!

631
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:30,580
- Hi, I'm Kabir.
- Laila.

632
00:39:30,581 --> 00:39:31,830
- This is Arjun.
- Hi.

633
00:39:31,914 --> 00:39:32,497
Laila.

634
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:35,372
Romeo?

635
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:37,038
You remember?

636
00:39:39,164 --> 00:39:40,622
Arjun...

637
00:39:40,623 --> 00:39:43,913
If you don't want to
dive, it's totally fine.

638
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:46,580
He can't swim.

639
00:39:49,123 --> 00:39:50,538
It's okay, doesn't matter.

640
00:39:51,081 --> 00:39:52,038
You'll be fine.

641
00:39:53,956 --> 00:39:54,497
Thank you.

642
00:39:55,956 --> 00:39:57,038
Shall we start?

643
00:39:57,664 --> 00:39:58,497
Let's go.

644
00:39:59,206 --> 00:40:01,247
It's a little difficuIt
to talk under water.

645
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:02,663
For obvious reasons.

646
00:40:02,914 --> 00:40:04,622
So these signs are very important.

647
00:40:05,956 --> 00:40:06,788
Up.

648
00:40:08,332 --> 00:40:09,664
Down.

649
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:11,539
Okay.

650
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:13,499
Not okay.

651
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:16,124
Air gauge.

652
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:21,332
Okay?

653
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:24,374
Alright!

654
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:28,499
You have to wear a wet suit.

655
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:30,332
The water is pretty cold.

656
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:34,499
Next is the BCD. Your
buoyancy control device.

657
00:40:35,791 --> 00:40:36,832
All okay?

658
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:40,665
These weights will help
you remain underwater.

659
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:49,415
Finally, your fins.

660
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,004
Cheers. Salute.

661
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:21,880
Good job, boys.

662
00:42:27,797 --> 00:42:29,213
So, when is the wedding?

663
00:42:30,964 --> 00:42:32,005
In two months.

664
00:42:32,006 --> 00:42:34,588
- That's like now, man.
- Yeah, I know.

665
00:42:34,672 --> 00:42:37,296
We only started dating
about six months ago.

666
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:38,796
Well, you know what they say...

667
00:42:38,881 --> 00:42:39,921
when it's right, it's right.

668
00:42:40,381 --> 00:42:41,380
That's what I said.

669
00:42:41,881 --> 00:42:42,671
Actually, she said it.

670
00:42:45,922 --> 00:42:46,671
What does she do?

671
00:42:47,214 --> 00:42:49,005
Interior design.
And she's bloody good.

672
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:50,505
Okay.

673
00:42:50,589 --> 00:42:52,255
And of course, her father
has a hotel business...

674
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:53,588
that's evaluated at...

675
00:42:54,297 --> 00:42:55,463
Ten billion?

676
00:42:55,797 --> 00:42:56,588
Ten billion.

677
00:42:57,922 --> 00:43:00,588
I'm not marrying her for her money.

678
00:43:00,714 --> 00:43:02,589
Kabir, of course not.

679
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,631
But you've got to admit,
it's a plus point.

680
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:07,715
Plus point? Are you serious?

681
00:43:08,341 --> 00:43:10,798
Would you marry for money?

682
00:43:11,549 --> 00:43:12,632
Depends.

683
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:13,840
How much?

684
00:43:15,883 --> 00:43:16,965
Ten billion!

685
00:43:17,924 --> 00:43:18,798
Definitely.

686
00:43:19,591 --> 00:43:21,673
And what if she's a bore?

687
00:43:23,091 --> 00:43:27,507
When you have ten billion in your bank
who needs the wife for entertainment?

688
00:43:27,716 --> 00:43:29,840
- Romantic.
- I agree, it's true.

689
00:43:30,299 --> 00:43:31,673
- Cheers!

690
00:43:34,716 --> 00:43:35,715
Are you seeing someone?

691
00:43:37,299 --> 00:43:38,423
Do you have a girIfriend?

692
00:43:39,008 --> 00:43:39,965
No.

693
00:43:41,716 --> 00:43:43,923
Hey... what about Rohini?
What happened there?

694
00:43:43,924 --> 00:43:46,008
- She was nice.
- Well...

695
00:43:46,009 --> 00:43:48,258
I guess she wanted different
things out of life.

696
00:43:48,925 --> 00:43:49,883
Laila...

697
00:43:50,592 --> 00:43:53,634
apart from my body what else
do you want out of life?

698
00:43:59,343 --> 00:44:02,717
I don't know. I haven't
really made a list.

699
00:44:02,885 --> 00:44:03,842
Still...

700
00:44:04,843 --> 00:44:06,467
there must be something.

701
00:44:09,426 --> 00:44:12,550
I guess, I want that...

702
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:15,217
life should continue to surprise me.

703
00:44:15,718 --> 00:44:16,925
Inspire me.

704
00:44:19,093 --> 00:44:20,550
Make me meet new people.

705
00:44:20,551 --> 00:44:23,509
Hola.

706
00:44:24,718 --> 00:44:25,509
- Hola.
- Hola?

707
00:44:26,176 --> 00:44:27,175
Sorry.

708
00:44:27,886 --> 00:44:29,260
Give me new experiences.

709
00:44:29,802 --> 00:44:30,843
And...

710
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,135
I want...

711
00:44:34,594 --> 00:44:35,635
you to get me a drink.

712
00:44:38,262 --> 00:44:39,261
Your wish is my command.

713
00:44:39,512 --> 00:44:40,844
- One for me, please.
- Arjun?

714
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:42,594
I'm okay.

715
00:44:49,762 --> 00:44:52,844
- Keep it down.
- Guys we're gonna get arrested.

716
00:44:53,053 --> 00:44:54,761
Its gonna to be fun.

717
00:44:57,178 --> 00:44:58,844
He's here. Quiet.

718
00:44:59,553 --> 00:45:01,011
Crazy.

719
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:03,594
I was just telling...

720
00:45:04,387 --> 00:45:06,969
that's the problem you see.

721
00:45:07,345 --> 00:45:09,719
Guys, watch out..

722
00:45:20,804 --> 00:45:21,804
Sorry.

723
00:45:45,972 --> 00:45:47,763
Your life is about to change.

724
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:51,554
That's if I survive!

725
00:45:54,515 --> 00:45:55,722
We'll see.

726
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:00,680
Yup, we'll see.

727
00:49:49,316 --> 00:49:51,733
The moment flows by like moIten sapphire

728
00:49:54,151 --> 00:49:56,400
Deep blue silences

729
00:49:58,234 --> 00:50:01,108
No earth below, no sky above

730
00:50:03,526 --> 00:50:06,566
The rustling branches and leaves

731
00:50:08,735 --> 00:50:10,942
Are saying only you are here

732
00:50:13,527 --> 00:50:14,526
Only me

733
00:50:15,693 --> 00:50:17,651
My breath and my heartbeat

734
00:50:20,193 --> 00:50:22,984
Such depth, such solitude

735
00:50:24,568 --> 00:50:26,234
And me

736
00:50:26,735 --> 00:50:27,567
Only me

737
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:31,609
I now believe I exist

738
00:50:44,694 --> 00:50:47,693
Baby, it was amazing.
You should definitely do it.

739
00:50:48,194 --> 00:50:49,735
I have no interest.

740
00:50:50,404 --> 00:50:51,236
Hey!

741
00:50:51,237 --> 00:50:51,778
Hey...

742
00:50:51,904 --> 00:50:54,486
Sorry. Can I use your loo?
Imran is taking a shower.

743
00:50:54,612 --> 00:50:55,403
Sure.

744
00:50:56,112 --> 00:50:56,944
Who is that?

745
00:50:57,445 --> 00:50:58,653
Wait. First say hi to Natasha.

746
00:51:00,154 --> 00:51:01,111
Okay.

747
00:51:02,029 --> 00:51:03,819
Hey... I'm Laila.

748
00:51:05,654 --> 00:51:06,278
Hi.

749
00:51:06,654 --> 00:51:08,819
Kabir has told me a lot about you.

750
00:51:08,904 --> 00:51:10,361
Congratulations in advance.

751
00:51:10,779 --> 00:51:11,653
Thanks.

752
00:51:12,154 --> 00:51:14,153
Well, it's really nice to meet you.

753
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,861
- Bye.
- Bye.

754
00:51:18,695 --> 00:51:19,694
Who is that?

755
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:21,737
That's Laila, our instructor.

756
00:51:21,738 --> 00:51:23,362
She's studying fashion in London but...

757
00:51:23,363 --> 00:51:26,237
three months a year she works
at dive sites around the world.

758
00:51:26,238 --> 00:51:27,445
Isn't that cool?

759
00:51:27,446 --> 00:51:28,237
Very cool.

760
00:51:28,238 --> 00:51:29,987
What is she doing in your room?

761
00:51:30,446 --> 00:51:31,654
She's using the bathroom.

762
00:51:35,406 --> 00:51:37,821
Imran invited her over for dinner.

763
00:51:37,822 --> 00:51:40,030
To celebrate our first dive.

764
00:51:40,572 --> 00:51:41,655
D'you think I'm stupid?

765
00:51:41,822 --> 00:51:43,696
What? It's the truth.

766
00:51:43,781 --> 00:51:44,821
Arjun is cooking.

767
00:51:45,114 --> 00:51:47,321
Yeah, you must be very busy.
I'll speak to you later.

768
00:51:47,906 --> 00:51:49,613
Natasha, why are you getting upset?

769
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,988
I'm not upset.
I've a flight to catch.

770
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:54,113
You're being really silly.

771
00:51:54,322 --> 00:51:55,321
Yeah, I know. Bye.

772
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:58,696
Bye.

773
00:52:01,906 --> 00:52:04,780
- All okay?
- Yeah, fine.

774
00:52:05,448 --> 00:52:07,281
- See you downstairs.
- See you.

775
00:52:18,324 --> 00:52:20,532
Need some help?

776
00:52:20,533 --> 00:52:22,407
Nope. Almost done.

777
00:52:26,116 --> 00:52:27,532
Paella.

778
00:52:27,533 --> 00:52:28,490
- Yup.
- Very nice.

779
00:52:29,116 --> 00:52:29,948
Thanks.

780
00:52:35,241 --> 00:52:36,198
So...

781
00:52:36,908 --> 00:52:38,615
you didn't tell me how it was.

782
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:42,573
Thank you.

783
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:45,990
Don't thank me.
You did it.

784
00:52:47,574 --> 00:52:50,533
So, how was it?

785
00:52:53,784 --> 00:52:55,199
It was magical.

786
00:52:57,492 --> 00:52:59,909
It feIt like the most
peaceful place on earth.

787
00:53:02,576 --> 00:53:03,742
It was beautiful.

788
00:53:05,368 --> 00:53:07,700
I was 16 when I did my first dive.

789
00:53:08,326 --> 00:53:11,200
And then stopping myseIf was impossible.

790
00:53:12,035 --> 00:53:13,825
Yeah, it could be addictive.

791
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:15,159
Addictive?

792
00:53:15,826 --> 00:53:16,825
No.

793
00:53:17,326 --> 00:53:18,784
Addiction is such a negative word.

794
00:53:19,618 --> 00:53:20,575
Diving is...

795
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:22,534
something else for me.

796
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,825
It's like meditation.

797
00:53:26,118 --> 00:53:30,159
You're conscious of every
breath, every moment.

798
00:53:30,785 --> 00:53:32,284
Just imagine...

799
00:53:32,368 --> 00:53:34,534
living your whole life like that.

800
00:53:35,411 --> 00:53:37,660
Be fully alive to each and every moment.

801
00:53:41,828 --> 00:53:42,702
Delicious.

802
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:43,619
- Seriously.
- Thank you.

803
00:53:43,703 --> 00:53:44,786
You should cook more often.

804
00:53:45,245 --> 00:53:46,286
I know man but...

805
00:53:46,745 --> 00:53:47,577
where's the time!

806
00:53:51,537 --> 00:53:53,702
So, the fear of water still there?

807
00:53:54,745 --> 00:53:55,702
Now there's no fear.

808
00:53:56,787 --> 00:53:57,827
Not even of life.

809
00:54:00,037 --> 00:54:02,577
Wow! In one dunk you've
unravelled the mystery of life!

810
00:54:03,162 --> 00:54:03,827
Well done, my lad.

811
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:07,494
Actually, it's quite simple.

812
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,536
What is it?

813
00:54:12,203 --> 00:54:13,161
Just...

814
00:54:14,453 --> 00:54:15,411
keep breathing.

815
00:54:21,788 --> 00:54:23,038
Laila!

816
00:54:23,789 --> 00:54:26,288
Finally, our old friend has surfaced.

817
00:54:27,247 --> 00:54:29,288
And to avoid a relapse...

818
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,663
why don't you join us on the trip?

819
00:54:32,455 --> 00:54:33,663
I'd love to.

820
00:54:33,747 --> 00:54:35,163
But I'm off to Bunol tomorrow.

821
00:54:35,664 --> 00:54:36,954
It's the Tomatina festival.

822
00:54:37,164 --> 00:54:38,038
- Too bad!
- Is it?

823
00:54:38,122 --> 00:54:40,038
Toma-tina, what's that?

824
00:54:40,039 --> 00:54:41,413
Arjun!

825
00:54:41,789 --> 00:54:43,663
How can you not know that...

826
00:54:43,664 --> 00:54:47,079
it is the world's largest tomato fight?!

827
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:51,996
It's like our festival of colours.
But played with tomatoes instead.

828
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:52,996
Really?

829
00:54:52,997 --> 00:54:55,663
Actually, you guys should come.

830
00:54:55,664 --> 00:54:56,663
It'll be a blast.

831
00:54:58,247 --> 00:54:58,663
I'm in.

832
00:54:59,164 --> 00:55:00,246
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm in.

833
00:55:00,247 --> 00:55:01,913
What? No!

834
00:55:01,997 --> 00:55:03,246
We're leaving for Seville tomorrow.

835
00:55:03,247 --> 00:55:04,914
That's perfect.
Bunol is en-route.

836
00:55:05,541 --> 00:55:06,540
- Come on.

837
00:55:07,624 --> 00:55:10,081
Look, Seville is Arjun's choice.

838
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:11,956
He made the reservations.

839
00:55:13,666 --> 00:55:16,623
To mess with Arjun's reservations is...

840
00:55:16,749 --> 00:55:18,081
like inviting Death!

841
00:55:24,332 --> 00:55:25,206
Come on.

842
00:55:29,416 --> 00:55:31,831
Alright, let me see what I can do.

843
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:36,873
Is that your phone?

844
00:55:43,124 --> 00:55:44,123
It's a long story.

845
00:55:44,999 --> 00:55:45,998
Let's not go there.

846
00:55:46,124 --> 00:55:47,456
No, it's nice.

847
00:55:48,458 --> 00:55:49,833
He's very much in touch
with his feminine side.

848
00:55:49,834 --> 00:55:50,875
Eat your food.

849
00:55:51,001 --> 00:55:53,625
Don't worry, even I like pink.

850
00:55:53,626 --> 00:55:54,875
Great, I feel much better. Thank you.

851
00:56:03,001 --> 00:56:04,208
How could you do this?

852
00:56:04,584 --> 00:56:06,667
Rohini, I'm really sorry but...

853
00:56:06,668 --> 00:56:08,292
can't you see that this
deal could help me.

854
00:56:08,376 --> 00:56:10,042
Can't you see that maybe I don't care!

855
00:56:10,209 --> 00:56:11,458
You don't care.

856
00:56:11,459 --> 00:56:13,583
- You don't care about my life?
- Stop it, Arjun.

857
00:56:13,584 --> 00:56:16,083
Don't confuse your work with your life.

858
00:56:16,376 --> 00:56:19,417
Your work isn't your life.
It's just a part of it.

859
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:22,625
Just like this relationship
is a part of your life.

860
00:56:22,626 --> 00:56:24,750
- What about this?
- What about this?

861
00:56:25,168 --> 00:56:27,667
I bought this apartment so
that we could live together.

862
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:29,625
What? Please!

863
00:56:29,626 --> 00:56:34,001
You bought this apartment to impress
people with your up market address.

864
00:56:34,002 --> 00:56:35,585
I can't believe you just said that.

865
00:56:35,586 --> 00:56:38,835
- I'm planning a future with you.
- Our future will come tomorrow, Arjun.

866
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,960
- Don't scream!
- Where is our today?

867
00:56:40,961 --> 00:56:42,169
Don't scream.

868
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:43,335
Then listen to me.

869
00:56:45,545 --> 00:56:46,627
What do you want?

870
00:56:47,211 --> 00:56:48,669
I want to spend time with you.

871
00:56:48,753 --> 00:56:52,419
I want a relationship.
Not a retirement plan.

872
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:53,794
Please, Rohini.

873
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:57,044
The chairman of Nakatomi Corporation
wants a meeting with me.

874
00:56:57,045 --> 00:56:58,669
What do I do?
I have to go.

875
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:04,044
If the presentation does it,
he'll give us the entire account.

876
00:57:04,128 --> 00:57:06,585
That will boost my career.

877
00:57:06,586 --> 00:57:08,044
Can't you see that?

878
00:57:08,128 --> 00:57:09,335
What about our deal?

879
00:57:10,461 --> 00:57:13,003
We can go next month.

880
00:57:13,962 --> 00:57:15,628
It's my birthday, Arjun.

881
00:57:16,629 --> 00:57:19,587
- I know.
- It won't come next month.

882
00:57:20,672 --> 00:57:24,754
You had promised that we would
go to Italy no matter what.

883
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:28,004
And you cancelled the tickets
without even talking to me.

884
00:57:30,755 --> 00:57:32,629
Rohini, I really am sorry.

885
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:35,796
Please understand.
Just a second.

886
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:40,171
It's an important call.
Just one second.

887
00:57:40,463 --> 00:57:41,796
Rohini, one second. Hello...

888
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:45,421
Yes, Alex...

889
00:57:46,547 --> 00:57:48,546
I'll be there in ten minutes.

890
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:15,548
Hey babe, I guess you're on the plane.

891
00:58:15,549 --> 00:58:20,631
I called to say that we're
going to Bunol tomorrow,
for the Tomatina festival

892
00:58:20,632 --> 00:58:22,631
Laila is taking us.

893
00:58:23,257 --> 00:58:24,631
Please don't be upset.

894
00:58:26,674 --> 00:58:30,173
Please call when you get
this message. I love you.

895
00:58:35,715 --> 00:58:36,923
Where the hell is he?

896
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:47,465
Oh - my - God!

897
00:58:53,801 --> 00:58:57,675
- I love it.
- Unbelievable!

898
00:58:57,759 --> 00:58:59,550
- Okay.
- Yes?

899
00:59:00,551 --> 00:59:01,591
- Can I drive?
- No.

900
00:59:02,592 --> 00:59:03,758
Kabira...

901
00:59:04,301 --> 00:59:07,633
if four days of diving
can do this to you.

902
00:59:07,634 --> 00:59:10,216
Trust me, you should stay under water.

903
00:59:10,592 --> 00:59:13,425
Who knows if I'll be
with you guys again...

904
00:59:13,426 --> 00:59:15,675
I decided, it's all or bust!

905
00:59:15,676 --> 00:59:17,258
- Right?
- Correct.

906
00:59:17,342 --> 00:59:19,466
Dude, you're getting married.

907
00:59:19,467 --> 00:59:21,551
You're not going to prison.

908
00:59:21,552 --> 00:59:22,634
Thanks.

909
00:59:23,552 --> 00:59:24,592
All set?

910
00:59:24,927 --> 00:59:25,967
- Arjun...

911
00:59:26,427 --> 00:59:27,509
can you help me?

912
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,259
- It's to the right.
- It's jammed, what did you do?

913
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:30,926
Dude!

914
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,427
You have to apply some force.

915
00:59:34,594 --> 00:59:36,260
No, just for the drive.

916
00:59:44,553 --> 00:59:45,760
- Hi.
- Hello.

917
00:59:47,761 --> 00:59:48,718
Child!

918
00:59:49,386 --> 00:59:50,593
Relax in the front seat.

919
00:59:50,594 --> 00:59:52,052
Driver... Bunol.

920
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:55,593
So Lailaji, hale and hearty
both packed in the bag?

921
01:00:02,344 --> 01:00:03,303
No, thanks.

922
01:00:18,637 --> 01:00:20,304
What are you doing?

923
01:00:20,846 --> 01:00:24,345
Laila, meet Bagwati.

924
01:00:27,638 --> 01:00:29,012
Hi Bagwati.

925
01:00:32,346 --> 01:00:34,220
Bagwati thinks you are very beautiful.

926
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:36,345
Thank you, Bagwati.

927
01:00:39,971 --> 01:00:41,595
The evening was hazy...

928
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:44,179
The mood was sad...

929
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:47,763
A thousand memories
vanished as they came...

930
01:00:49,472 --> 01:00:52,471
That's really nice.
You wrote it?

931
01:00:52,472 --> 01:00:53,596
I wish...

932
01:00:53,597 --> 01:00:55,888
It's by Raghupati Sahai Firaq.

933
01:00:56,597 --> 01:00:58,721
Even our man writes quite well.

934
01:00:59,431 --> 01:01:00,430
- Really?
- Thanks man.

935
01:01:01,222 --> 01:01:03,638
- What say, Kabir?
- Of course.

936
01:01:08,265 --> 01:01:11,681

01:01:28,308 --> 01:01:29,473
Diamond biscuit!

942
01:01:30,558 --> 01:01:33,140
- So beautiful.
- One has to do it, assholes!

943
01:01:33,141 --> 01:01:35,015
Inspired writing.

944
01:01:35,641 --> 01:01:38,432
- It's kind of nice.
- Isn't it?

945
01:01:39,558 --> 01:01:41,432
Brought a smile to your face, didn't it?

946
01:01:41,433 --> 01:01:42,432
Hello.

947
01:01:42,724 --> 01:01:44,307
Hi, it's me.

948
01:01:44,683 --> 01:01:47,432
- Where are you?
- Just landed in London.

949
01:01:48,767 --> 01:01:50,141
Look...

950
01:01:50,142 --> 01:01:52,724
I'm sorry I hung up yesterday.

951
01:01:53,767 --> 01:01:55,641
It's okay. You know what,
just forget about it.

952
01:01:56,225 --> 01:01:57,391
Thank you.

953
01:01:58,475 --> 01:01:59,808
So, you're going Bunol?

954
01:01:59,892 --> 01:02:02,933
Yes! Yeah, they went up from
being the number four biscuit..

955
01:02:03,059 --> 01:02:04,558
..To number one biscuit.

956
01:02:06,809 --> 01:02:08,016
Chee!

957
01:02:08,017 --> 01:02:10,975
- What happened?
- What are you doing?

958
01:02:17,601 --> 01:02:18,184
Yes.

959
01:02:19,935 --> 01:02:23,600
- Laila, where are we staying?
- Hotel Venta Pilar.

960
01:02:24,143 --> 01:02:26,309
Some Venta Pilar...

961
01:02:27,393 --> 01:02:28,600
Venta Pilar.

962
01:02:29,768 --> 01:02:31,225
Okay, fine.

963
01:02:32,351 --> 01:02:33,560
Well you have fun, okay.

964
01:02:34,352 --> 01:02:35,560
Okay, of course.

965
01:02:35,602 --> 01:02:36,810
Venta Pilar.

966
01:02:37,977 --> 01:02:38,851
Arjun...

967
01:02:39,977 --> 01:02:40,935
what are you doing man?

968
01:02:41,686 --> 01:02:43,601
- Again?
- What are you doing?

969
01:02:43,602 --> 01:02:46,226
I'm sorry, it's the wind.
I'm really sorry.

970
01:02:46,227 --> 01:02:46,810
Really?

971
01:02:48,561 --> 01:02:54,019
By the way, Bagwati is feeling
kinda hot. I'll let her get
some wind by the window.

972
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:10,727
- Turn left here.
- Yeah?

973
01:03:13,687 --> 01:03:15,311
- I know I'll see her somewhere.

974
01:03:16,395 --> 01:03:17,394
There she is.

975
01:03:26,188 --> 01:03:27,562
- Hola!

976
01:03:33,271 --> 01:03:34,395
Everybody this is Nuria.

977
01:03:34,563 --> 01:03:36,396
- Hola.
- Arjun.

978
01:03:37,189 --> 01:03:38,354
- That's Kabir.
- Hello.

979
01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:39,688
And that's Imran in the corner.

980
01:03:40,397 --> 01:03:42,229
- Hola!

981
01:03:47,814 --> 01:03:49,563
She's saying it's already started.

982
01:03:49,564 --> 01:03:50,729
We have to go.
We're going to miss it.

983
01:03:51,605 --> 01:03:52,271
Imran.

984
01:03:52,355 --> 01:03:54,563
- The bags?
- These guys will take care of them.

985
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:57,979
- But my laptop.
- Arjun, let's go. Come on!

986
01:03:58,439 --> 01:03:59,771
- Okay.
- Imran.

987
01:04:01,064 --> 01:04:02,313
We're leaving you.

988
01:04:11,023 --> 01:04:11,647
Laila...

989
01:04:12,731 --> 01:04:14,314
your friend is very cute.

990
01:04:14,981 --> 01:04:16,272
Is that so?

991
01:04:16,273 --> 01:04:17,773
You've already forgotten me?!

992
01:04:18,232 --> 01:04:19,231
You're pathetic!

993
01:04:19,774 --> 01:04:20,731
Laila...

994
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:24,398
You will go down in
history as my first love.

995
01:04:28,232 --> 01:04:29,565
Okay listen guys, there are two rules.

996
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:31,648
You have to make way for the trucks.

997
01:04:31,649 --> 01:04:33,940
And squash the tomatoes
before throwing them.

998
01:04:34,566 --> 01:04:35,648
Otherwise it hurts.

999
01:04:35,649 --> 01:04:37,440
Alright? Let's go!

1000
01:04:40,357 --> 01:04:42,731
- Kabira, squash it.
- Did it hurt?

1001
01:04:43,482 --> 01:04:44,690
- Of course.
- Shit man!

1002
01:04:48,275 --> 01:04:50,774
What are you guys doing?
There are rules.

1003
01:04:51,025 --> 01:04:53,649
Have you ever followed a rule in your
life? You bastard, now you want rules!

1004
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:54,816
Come here!

1005
01:04:55,442 --> 01:04:58,649
Come here I'll tell you the rules.

1006
01:05:03,776 --> 01:05:05,108
Come on!

1007
01:05:17,693 --> 01:05:21,358
Ooh aah.. Take the
world and paint it red

1008
01:05:21,443 --> 01:05:32,192
Ooh aah.. Paint it red

1009
01:05:32,276 --> 01:05:35,443
There's a passion, a madness

1010
01:05:35,985 --> 01:05:38,526
All around

1011
01:05:39,819 --> 01:05:43,235
A carefree gladness

1012
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:46,069
All around

1013
01:05:47,695 --> 01:05:51,402
Somewhere lightly, the colours fall

1014
01:05:51,486 --> 01:05:54,902
Stories of yesterday, you can't recall

1015
01:05:55,236 --> 01:05:58,985
Someone softly tells my heart

1016
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:02,985
Give yourseIf away, let the magic start

1017
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:17,527
Ooh aah.. Take the
world and paint it red

1018
01:06:17,611 --> 01:06:23,570
An obsession. A passion.
Everywhere, everywhere.

1019
01:06:25,112 --> 01:06:31,154
A trance. A trance. A trance.
Everywhere, everywhere.

1020
01:06:48,197 --> 01:06:51,904
This moment that's so whole
Seems high on its own

1021
01:06:51,988 --> 01:06:55,404
This moment unveils
its intoxication on you

1022
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:59,446
Now you're in the mood You
hold hands with the groove

1023
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:02,821
As voices blend in with the hues

1024
01:07:02,906 --> 01:07:16,364
And we go on and on and on and on.

1025
01:07:18,407 --> 01:07:22,114
The colors of life splash aloud.

1026
01:07:22,199 --> 01:07:25,864
Just put the past behind you.

1027
01:07:25,949 --> 01:07:29,698
Someone softly speaks from my heart.

1028
01:07:29,782 --> 01:07:33,823
Let the spell take over you.

1029
01:07:33,907 --> 01:08:33,535
Ooh aah.. Take the
world and paint it red

1030
01:08:33,703 --> 01:08:34,577
I'm feeling cold now.

1031
01:08:35,953 --> 01:08:37,202
And it's stinking too.

1032
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:44,577
You're going to get this.

1033
01:08:48,203 --> 01:08:49,493
- She's going to get it.
- Put me down!

1034
01:08:56,619 --> 01:08:57,368
Kabir?

1035
01:08:59,244 --> 01:09:00,243
Natasha?

1036
01:09:03,619 --> 01:09:04,452
What are you doing?

1037
01:09:08,869 --> 01:09:09,577
Hi...

1038
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,912
I came here to surprise you.

1039
01:09:20,996 --> 01:09:22,745
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

1040
01:09:23,871 --> 01:09:24,704
I am happy.

1041
01:09:24,788 --> 01:09:25,787
Yeah, you look it.

1042
01:09:27,205 --> 01:09:27,954
Natasha...

1043
01:09:28,663 --> 01:09:30,037
this is my bachelor trip.

1044
01:09:30,038 --> 01:09:32,829
And you know, I want to spend
this time with my friends.

1045
01:09:32,913 --> 01:09:34,745
Really? Laila is your friend?

1046
01:09:35,163 --> 01:09:39,287
She's our diving instructor.
I told you on the phone.

1047
01:09:39,288 --> 01:09:40,954
And the other one... Nancy?

1048
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:42,454
Nuria.

1049
01:09:42,455 --> 01:09:43,870
Whatever!

1050
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:48,412
Oh God, Natasha!
I just met her this morning!

1051
01:09:48,413 --> 01:09:51,995
She was kind enough to give
us her room. We'll probably
never see each other again!

1052
01:09:52,496 --> 01:09:54,495
That's just perfect!

1053
01:09:54,496 --> 01:09:56,329
No one will ever know what happened.

1054
01:09:58,081 --> 01:09:59,955
Is that why you are here?

1055
01:10:00,497 --> 01:10:03,706
The apology on the phone was just
an excuse to get the address.

1056
01:10:04,248 --> 01:10:05,914
How dare you, Kabir?

1057
01:10:06,998 --> 01:10:08,372
- That's really mature...
- Shut up!

1058
01:10:09,915 --> 01:10:10,789
Who is it?

1059
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:11,831
Imran.

1060
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,206
Come in.

1061
01:10:16,290 --> 01:10:17,497
- Hi.
- Hey.

1062
01:10:17,498 --> 01:10:19,372
I'm sorry, I just need my bag.

1063
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:21,664
Don't apologise, it's totally cool.

1064
01:10:21,832 --> 01:10:30,789
Thanks.

1065
01:10:31,248 --> 01:10:33,247
We've made dinner plans,
would you like to join us?

1066
01:10:33,998 --> 01:10:35,706
- Actually...
- Yes.

1067
01:10:35,707 --> 01:10:37,414
Definitely, sounds like fun.

1068
01:10:37,957 --> 01:10:40,915
Okay, I'll call when we're heading out.

1069
01:10:45,874 --> 01:10:46,915
We don't have to go.

1070
01:10:46,916 --> 01:10:49,166
I don't want your friends
to think I'm a witch!

1071
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,416
Witch alert!

1072
01:10:53,834 --> 01:10:55,291
Our holiday is in danger.

1073
01:10:56,042 --> 01:10:56,833
Who is next?

1074
01:11:01,167 --> 01:11:02,791
Even I love you very much.

1075
01:11:09,042 --> 01:11:11,499
Dude, I can't believe Natasha's here.

1076
01:11:11,584 --> 01:11:12,666
I'm shocked!

1077
01:11:13,542 --> 01:11:15,708
Why? What's the big deal?

1078
01:11:15,834 --> 01:11:17,083
Laila...

1079
01:11:17,209 --> 01:11:21,083
your fiancee can't crash your
bachelor party. That's the only rule!

1080
01:11:21,792 --> 01:11:22,541
Rule?

1081
01:11:23,876 --> 01:11:26,125
- You guys are so stupid.
- What?

1082
01:11:26,501 --> 01:11:27,917
Stupid?

1083
01:11:27,918 --> 01:11:28,792
You're stupid.

1084
01:11:29,626 --> 01:11:31,500
Natasha hates you.

1085
01:11:32,001 --> 01:11:32,835
What?

1086
01:11:32,836 --> 01:11:34,501
Yes, she said...

1087
01:11:34,586 --> 01:11:35,960
Is Laila your friend?

1088
01:11:36,211 --> 01:11:37,043
She asked you that?

1089
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:40,460
No, she asked Kabir. I was
eavesdropping outside the door.

1090
01:11:40,544 --> 01:11:41,918
There that Natasha.

1091
01:11:42,002 --> 01:11:43,168
Of course.
- Here these tomatoes.

1092
01:11:47,877 --> 01:11:49,585
How do you say,
'can I come in', in Spanish?

1093
01:11:51,211 --> 01:11:53,418
Dude, what're you doing?
Don't be stupid!

1094
01:11:57,377 --> 01:11:58,126
Yes?

1095
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:07,086
See you in the lobby.

1096
01:12:34,879 --> 01:12:38,920
I want to learn Flamenco.
It looks like so much fun.

1097
01:12:39,004 --> 01:12:41,670
Laila, you live in Spain?

1098
01:12:41,879 --> 01:12:43,378
No, in London.

1099
01:12:44,629 --> 01:12:45,920
So does Arjun.

1100
01:12:46,879 --> 01:12:47,545
Yeah.

1101
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:50,838
Kabir and I will be
there after this holiday.

1102
01:12:50,839 --> 01:12:52,088
We should definitely get together.

1103
01:12:52,547 --> 01:12:54,004
Yeah, we should.

1104
01:12:54,005 --> 01:12:56,921
I'd love to but I'm off
to Morocco from here.

1105
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:58,338
For a month.

1106
01:12:58,630 --> 01:12:59,588
Wow!

1107
01:13:00,089 --> 01:13:02,672
I think all of you should
come to Seville with us.

1108
01:13:03,006 --> 01:13:05,422
I'm going back to London tomorrow.

1109
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,672
You only came here for a day?

1110
01:13:07,673 --> 01:13:08,297
Yeah.

1111
01:13:08,673 --> 01:13:10,839
Kabir wants to hang with the two of you.

1112
01:13:11,465 --> 01:13:14,089
I don't want to disturb your plans.

1113
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:16,964
Don't be silly, Natasha.
You're hardly a disturbance.

1114
01:13:19,423 --> 01:13:21,505
- That's really sweet, Imran.
Thank you.

1115
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:25,964
But, Kabir said it's a miracle
to get you two together.

1116
01:13:26,548 --> 01:13:29,714
And you have to attend
the wedding. No excuses.

1117
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:30,840
100 percent!

1118
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:32,465
Of course!

1119
01:13:34,049 --> 01:13:35,048
Excuses...

1120
01:13:35,466 --> 01:13:37,506
Could we get the more the red the wines?

1121
01:13:40,174 --> 01:13:42,673
Arjun, the translation
into the Espanols?

1122
01:13:45,924 --> 01:13:46,966
Imran, please!

1123
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:51,257
It's because of such behaviour
that Indians have a bad reputation.

1124
01:13:52,092 --> 01:13:53,382
Will you please tell him?

1125
01:13:55,717 --> 01:13:56,716
Imran, don't do it.

1126
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:58,841
Chee!

1127
01:13:59,967 --> 01:14:01,174
What chee?
He is right!

1128
01:14:01,883 --> 01:14:04,841
I agree with you.
Imran, it's wrong.

1129
01:14:04,842 --> 01:14:06,049
No.

1130
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:07,174
I'm the very the sorry

1131
01:14:09,008 --> 01:14:09,841
No, I'm sorry.

1132
01:14:09,842 --> 01:14:10,716
Not funny!

1133
01:14:17,009 --> 01:14:19,050
- Been to Morocco?
- Morocco? No!

1134
01:14:19,051 --> 01:14:20,550
- Good night, guys.
- Good night.

1135
01:14:20,843 --> 01:14:22,092
Let's go?

1136
01:14:22,176 --> 01:14:23,508
It's amazing.

1137
01:14:23,593 --> 01:14:24,758
In a bit.

1138
01:14:25,968 --> 01:14:27,008
Moshi moshi.

1139
01:14:27,593 --> 01:14:29,717
- Will you do me a favour?
- No way!

1140
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:34,968
Why don't you both take a long walk?

1141
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:41,884
Dude, it's late, we're
tired. You must be tired.

1142
01:14:41,885 --> 01:14:43,884
- You must be tired.
- No, not really.

1143
01:14:43,885 --> 01:14:46,343
That's the spirit.
The night is young.

1144
01:14:46,427 --> 01:14:48,509
You two aren't that old either!

1145
01:14:48,594 --> 01:14:50,593
I'm sure you'll come up with some plan.

1146
01:14:53,844 --> 01:14:56,135
- You sure?
- Come on.

1147
01:15:34,512 --> 01:15:36,345
Shit! I forgot my phone.

1148
01:15:37,888 --> 01:15:38,846
Aren't you on a holiday?

1149
01:15:40,555 --> 01:15:42,929
And, you are absolutely right.

1150
01:15:47,097 --> 01:15:48,221
Do you have a boyfriend?

1151
01:15:49,013 --> 01:15:49,929
No.

1152
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:50,679
Really?

1153
01:15:51,597 --> 01:15:52,554
Why not?

1154
01:15:53,972 --> 01:15:55,887
You see, the guys I liked...

1155
01:15:55,888 --> 01:15:59,012
wanted different things out of life.

1156
01:16:03,431 --> 01:16:06,097
What kind of guys do you like?

1157
01:16:06,181 --> 01:16:07,638
What's your type?

1158
01:16:07,639 --> 01:16:09,013
I don't have a type.

1159
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:10,638
Come on, everyone has a type.

1160
01:16:11,473 --> 01:16:12,847
Really?

1161
01:16:13,431 --> 01:16:16,930
Like I know, a guy who gets only
three weeks off in a year...

1162
01:16:16,931 --> 01:16:18,180
isn't your type.

1163
01:16:18,264 --> 01:16:20,889
He can't be anyone's type.

1164
01:16:21,015 --> 01:16:23,306
He has no time.

1165
01:16:23,307 --> 01:16:24,889
He is a slave.

1166
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:28,723
And one who only thinks of his
career, isn't your type either.

1167
01:16:28,724 --> 01:16:31,889
If he only thinks about his
career, then he is a bore.

1168
01:16:33,015 --> 01:16:35,973
Or someone who thinks money is
the most important thing in life.

1169
01:16:36,807 --> 01:16:38,223
Like you!

1170
01:16:41,807 --> 01:16:43,764
You don't know anything about me.

1171
01:16:45,057 --> 01:16:46,014
So?

1172
01:16:47,641 --> 01:16:48,849
So, don't judge me.

1173
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:53,765
I wasn't judging you.

1174
01:16:54,808 --> 01:16:56,682
I'm merely asking...

1175
01:16:56,683 --> 01:16:59,432
does money really make you happy?

1176
01:17:01,725 --> 01:17:03,808
I was eight when my dad passed away.

1177
01:17:04,684 --> 01:17:07,933
Leaving behind a huge
debt for my mother.

1178
01:17:08,892 --> 01:17:11,266
Very early I understood that...

1179
01:17:11,809 --> 01:17:13,891
only money makes the world go round.

1180
01:17:13,892 --> 01:17:15,433
Simple as that.

1181
01:17:20,434 --> 01:17:21,891
- I understand, Arjun.

1182
01:17:22,017 --> 01:17:24,350
But you still haven't
answered my question.

1183
01:17:25,476 --> 01:17:27,891
Yes, money makes me happy.

1184
01:17:28,934 --> 01:17:30,683
Then why did you cry, the other day...

1185
01:17:32,018 --> 01:17:32,976
after the dive?

1186
01:17:33,893 --> 01:17:37,934
Has a paycheque ever
brought tears to your eyes?

1187
01:17:38,977 --> 01:17:40,351
- No,

1188
01:17:40,852 --> 01:17:42,226
Think about it.

1189
01:17:42,935 --> 01:17:45,602
When you've done so well in life...

1190
01:17:45,686 --> 01:17:47,018
are you really happy?

1191
01:17:49,644 --> 01:17:51,852
Even today if you feel
something is missing...

1192
01:17:52,936 --> 01:17:54,935
what is it?

1193
01:17:56,019 --> 01:17:58,310
Take time out for things that...

1194
01:17:58,311 --> 01:18:00,268
give you genuine joy.

1195
01:18:00,394 --> 01:18:01,643
Like cooking.

1196
01:18:01,644 --> 01:18:03,518
Well, that's the plan, I mean...

1197
01:18:03,603 --> 01:18:05,393
I'll retire at 40 and...

1198
01:18:05,394 --> 01:18:06,352
Dude!

1199
01:18:06,853 --> 01:18:09,310
How do you know if you'll
be alive till then?

1200
01:18:11,894 --> 01:18:13,810
Seize the day, my friend.

1201
01:18:13,811 --> 01:18:16,311
First, live this day to the fullest.

1202
01:18:16,312 --> 01:18:17,894
Then think about 40.

1203
01:18:26,645 --> 01:18:27,311
Come on.

1204
01:18:35,896 --> 01:18:38,645
My friends don't know
why I made them come here.

1205
01:18:49,271 --> 01:18:51,562
I want to meet Salman Habib.

1206
01:19:03,189 --> 01:19:04,771
I've never met him.

1207
01:19:06,939 --> 01:19:08,355
I have never met my father.

1208
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:20,481
What if he doesn't want to meet me?

1209
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:41,939
Why are we lying here?

1210
01:19:43,857 --> 01:19:46,357
I mean, it's ridiculous.

1211
01:19:46,441 --> 01:19:47,732
No.

1212
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:51,065
It's ridiculous that you've
never done this before.

1213
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:53,941
What to do?

1214
01:19:54,859 --> 01:19:56,941
I'm stuck with a
beautiful home in London.

1215
01:19:58,859 --> 01:20:03,024
Only someone who has never
slept under the stars...

1216
01:20:03,025 --> 01:20:05,191
can say something so stupid.

1217
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:09,024
Wow man.

1218
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:13,274
I should learn from you.

1219
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:19,983
I feel like I've spent my life in a box.

1220
01:20:22,442 --> 01:20:24,024
But you...

1221
01:20:26,317 --> 01:20:27,941
you are free.

1222
01:20:32,276 --> 01:20:33,942
You're free, Laila.

1223
01:20:35,902 --> 01:20:37,193
Arjun...

1224
01:20:40,361 --> 01:20:44,193
The only time a man
should be in a box...

1225
01:20:44,194 --> 01:20:46,151
is when he's dead.

1226
01:21:08,944 --> 01:21:11,651
Natasha, stay for a few more days.

1227
01:21:11,861 --> 01:21:12,943
You don't mean that.

1228
01:21:13,194 --> 01:21:14,485
No, I do.

1229
01:21:14,611 --> 01:21:16,361
I don't like it that you're so sad.

1230
01:21:16,862 --> 01:21:18,278
What do you expect?

1231
01:21:18,404 --> 01:21:22,028
How would you feel if I just left
you and took off with my friends?

1232
01:21:23,404 --> 01:21:24,695
You have your own life.

1233
01:21:25,196 --> 01:21:27,820
And if you and Sameera ever
decide to go on a trip...

1234
01:21:28,529 --> 01:21:29,778
why would I stop you?

1235
01:21:30,029 --> 01:21:33,070
And if I told you that
we've met some guys...

1236
01:21:33,071 --> 01:21:35,487
and made dinner plans with them, then?

1237
01:21:35,863 --> 01:21:38,070
Then what?

1238
01:21:38,821 --> 01:21:40,737
I trust you.

1239
01:21:40,738 --> 01:21:43,903
Of course I'd want
you both to be safe...

1240
01:21:44,488 --> 01:21:45,903
but besides that, I won't suspect you.

1241
01:21:45,904 --> 01:21:48,237
I'm sorry, but it's
easier said than done.

1242
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:51,028
Babe...

1243
01:21:52,863 --> 01:21:54,737
you're welcome to stay if you want to.

1244
01:21:54,821 --> 01:21:57,487
But if you don't, I'll drive
you to the airport tomorrow.

1245
01:22:00,698 --> 01:22:01,572
Good night.

1246
01:22:13,656 --> 01:22:15,864
- I'll miss you.
- Take care.

1247
01:22:16,906 --> 01:22:18,780
- Stay in touch.
See you at the wedding.

1248
01:22:18,865 --> 01:22:20,322
- Imran, can you help me?
- Of course.

1249
01:22:20,406 --> 01:22:21,697
For sure. Okay?

1250
01:22:21,698 --> 01:22:23,322
- Email me.
- I will.

1251
01:22:23,323 --> 01:22:24,072
Good luck.

1252
01:22:27,281 --> 01:22:28,322
Hey...

1253
01:22:33,531 --> 01:22:35,155
Yesterday was...

1254
01:22:37,156 --> 01:22:38,322
I jus..

1255
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,864
I had the best time yesterday.

1256
01:22:42,323 --> 01:22:43,490
Me too.

1257
01:22:45,324 --> 01:22:47,116
And good luck...

1258
01:22:47,117 --> 01:22:49,491
for your upcoming adventures.

1259
01:22:51,617 --> 01:22:52,907
Thanks.

1260
01:23:07,658 --> 01:23:08,616
I'll see you.

1261
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:17,241
Bye.

1262
01:23:17,825 --> 01:23:18,657
Ciao.

1263
01:23:42,702 --> 01:23:45,534
A thought came alive, but away it hid

1264
01:23:45,535 --> 01:23:48,201
It stole a glance,
from under the eyelids

1265
01:23:48,285 --> 01:23:52,576
Sometimes from you, sometimes from
me it asked for words to set it free

1266
01:23:55,244 --> 01:23:58,701
Words to wear, so from
the lips it can flee

1267
01:23:58,702 --> 01:24:02,159
A voice it can embrace
and sway with glee

1268
01:24:03,410 --> 01:24:07,201
But this thought Is a
feeling... just a feeling

1269
01:24:10,828 --> 01:24:12,952
Like a fragrance floating in the breeze

1270
01:24:13,828 --> 01:24:15,953
A fragrance that is unspeaking

1271
01:24:16,912 --> 01:24:19,495
You live with it

1272
01:24:19,496 --> 01:24:21,578
I'm aware of it

1273
01:24:22,121 --> 01:24:24,120
Out in the open for the world to see

1274
01:24:24,204 --> 01:24:26,495
What is this unknown mystery?

1275
01:25:54,958 --> 01:25:56,124
Who is it?

1276
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:12,582
Laila?

1277
01:26:20,917 --> 01:26:22,291
You'll forgot something?

1278
01:26:42,877 --> 01:26:44,792
I hate regrets.

1279
01:26:47,377 --> 01:26:48,959
Then you shouldn't have any.

1280
01:27:07,044 --> 01:27:08,043
Bye.

1281
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:31,711
Flying away in the open sky...

1282
01:27:31,712 --> 01:27:35,836
Are the birds of my dreams

1283
01:27:38,754 --> 01:27:41,545
Flying away...

1284
01:27:42,213 --> 01:27:46,837
To the land of my heart
are the birds of my dreams

1285
01:27:52,046 --> 01:27:57,545
Don't know where they'll go next

1286
01:28:00,631 --> 01:28:05,796
Wings have taken flight and now
says my sight you've finally awoken

1287
01:28:06,131 --> 01:28:11,380
What was on your mind is left behind
You've moved far ahead in time

1288
01:28:12,339 --> 01:28:17,338
Life is floating on a breeze

1289
01:28:17,922 --> 01:28:23,006
Life is telling you and me

1290
01:28:26,298 --> 01:28:30,797
Now whatever will be will be

1291
01:28:35,215 --> 01:28:44,465
Flying away in the open sky
are the birds of my dreams

1292
01:28:46,466 --> 01:28:55,923
Flying away.. To the land of my
heart are the birds of my dreams

1293
01:28:57,383 --> 01:29:06,758
Don't know where they'll go next

1294
01:29:08,342 --> 01:29:13,799
A touch from someone and I've
been wandering without a thought

1295
01:29:13,925 --> 01:29:20,133
Somewhere new words were spoken
and since then I've been lost

1296
01:29:20,134 --> 01:29:25,174
Something made the heart meIt

1297
01:29:26,050 --> 01:29:30,800
In a blink, I was someone else

1298
01:29:34,051 --> 01:29:38,300
Now whatever will be will be

1299
01:29:47,926 --> 01:29:56,176
A light shone down Now there's a
beauty being showered on the streets

1300
01:29:59,094 --> 01:30:07,760
Happiness came down Now there's
a zest being showered upon me

1301
01:30:09,011 --> 01:30:15,386
Now I finally know who I was meant to be

1302
01:30:18,928 --> 01:30:24,594
Do you remember that moment yesterday
The one with the magic force?

1303
01:30:24,678 --> 01:30:30,762
It transformed us into something
new I wonder which moment it was?

1304
01:30:30,846 --> 01:30:34,637
The heart says just blindy go to

1305
01:30:36,388 --> 01:30:41,053
Any place that desire takes you

1306
01:30:44,846 --> 01:30:50,803
Now whatever will be will be

1307
01:30:52,763 --> 01:31:08,929
Now whatever will be will be..
- Flying..

1308
01:31:15,348 --> 01:31:19,014
Now whatever will be will be

1309
01:31:21,848 --> 01:31:23,889
What do you mean, you've quit your job?

1310
01:31:23,890 --> 01:31:24,930
Meaning?

1311
01:31:24,931 --> 01:31:27,139
We're getting married in two months.

1312
01:31:27,223 --> 01:31:29,514
So? You can resume after the wedding.

1313
01:31:30,473 --> 01:31:31,514
How?

1314
01:31:31,848 --> 01:31:33,555
First, we'll go on the honeymoon...

1315
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:36,139
then I want to redo the house.

1316
01:31:36,140 --> 01:31:38,389
That will take about a year.

1317
01:31:38,848 --> 01:31:41,555
And if you're going to Singapore
for your new project...

1318
01:31:41,556 --> 01:31:43,347
I'll be coming with you.

1319
01:31:46,016 --> 01:31:47,056
But...

1320
01:31:47,057 --> 01:31:49,223
that hotel is your
dream project, Natasha.

1321
01:31:49,682 --> 01:31:51,056
Dreams change baby.

1322
01:31:52,016 --> 01:31:55,098
Then, I didn't know
I'd be getting married.

1323
01:31:55,099 --> 01:31:56,057
Married?

1324
01:31:57,350 --> 01:31:59,141
What does marriage have to do with it?

1325
01:31:59,433 --> 01:32:01,141
What do you mean?

1326
01:32:01,142 --> 01:32:02,932
Obviously, priorities change.

1327
01:32:03,725 --> 01:32:07,141
After the wedding, even you wouldn't
want to go on this kind of boys holiday

1328
01:32:19,433 --> 01:32:21,641
- When is her flight?
- At 6 p.m.

1329
01:32:24,475 --> 01:32:26,932
Don't worry man, we'll make it.

1330
01:32:27,892 --> 01:32:28,933
Yeah.

1331
01:32:34,643 --> 01:32:35,808
Very funny!

1332
01:32:38,977 --> 01:32:39,768
All okay, babe?

1333
01:32:40,269 --> 01:32:40,934
Yeah.

1334
01:32:41,894 --> 01:32:42,893
Can I drive?

1335
01:32:45,935 --> 01:32:47,809
Can you drive?

1336
01:32:55,435 --> 01:32:58,851
Babe, the speed limit is
120. You can go faster.

1337
01:32:58,852 --> 01:33:01,018
Yes, we may just miss that flight.

1338
01:33:01,977 --> 01:33:03,851
I'm not going to drive rashly.

1339
01:33:04,102 --> 01:33:05,309
Watch out!

1340
01:33:07,269 --> 01:33:09,434
Please keep your eyes
on the road, please!

1341
01:33:09,894 --> 01:33:11,893
Then tell him not to talk to me.

1342
01:33:11,894 --> 01:33:13,309
Don't talk to her.

1343
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:19,727
I love this song.

1344
01:33:23,271 --> 01:33:26,936
Rock chick in a hard rock world...

1345
01:33:30,062 --> 01:33:34,020
I'm a rock chick in a hard rock world...

1346
01:33:37,021 --> 01:33:41,061
Nothing rocks better
than a rock chick girl...

1347
01:33:44,062 --> 01:33:48,186
I'm a rock chick in a hard rock world...

1348
01:33:52,354 --> 01:33:53,561
I had fun.

1349
01:33:56,854 --> 01:33:57,936
Listen...

1350
01:34:01,605 --> 01:34:02,646
I'm sorry.

1351
01:34:04,064 --> 01:34:04,855
Me too.

1352
01:34:05,856 --> 01:34:06,855
Bye Bagwati.

1353
01:34:17,981 --> 01:34:18,772
Tell me...

1354
01:34:19,356 --> 01:34:21,230
what do you think about them?

1355
01:34:24,731 --> 01:34:27,147
- Kabir is not himseIf when Natasha
is around. - That's what I thought.

1356
01:34:27,939 --> 01:34:28,772
Correct.

1357
01:34:30,481 --> 01:34:31,938
I sense some tension.

1358
01:34:33,856 --> 01:34:34,730
Did you speak with him?

1359
01:34:36,689 --> 01:34:37,272
Why should l?

1360
01:34:38,064 --> 01:34:40,813
If a friend doesn't address a
personal problem, then who will?

1361
01:34:42,439 --> 01:34:43,939
Forget it man!

1362
01:34:43,940 --> 01:34:46,107
They'll sort their problem and
we'll get screwed in the middle.

1363
01:34:46,275 --> 01:34:47,107
Chee, man!

1364
01:34:48,066 --> 01:34:49,690
You are seriously shameless.

1365
01:34:49,691 --> 01:34:50,524
What?

1366
01:34:52,316 --> 01:34:54,774
Look... he is our friend.

1367
01:34:54,775 --> 01:34:56,649
When he is back, let's talk to him.

1368
01:34:58,983 --> 01:34:59,732
Okay?

1369
01:35:01,650 --> 01:35:02,107
Okay.

1370
01:35:24,691 --> 01:35:25,357
God!

1371
01:35:26,025 --> 01:35:27,107
Now what has he done?

1372
01:35:28,234 --> 01:35:31,317
He's buried inside his diary
again. He's too boring.

1373
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:33,401
What do you write in it?

1374
01:35:33,943 --> 01:35:34,942
It's private.

1375
01:35:35,943 --> 01:35:36,859
Rascal...

1376
01:35:37,443 --> 01:35:38,817
you've always been secretive.

1377
01:35:39,027 --> 01:35:42,067
- But there's nothing to tell.
- No, no, no!

1378
01:35:42,068 --> 01:35:44,317
You're obviously struggling
with an emotional problem.

1379
01:35:45,485 --> 01:35:47,109
What? Me?

1380
01:35:47,235 --> 01:35:48,442
Arjun...

1381
01:35:48,443 --> 01:35:50,276
I truly believe that...

1382
01:35:50,277 --> 01:35:54,276
if a friend doesn't address a
personal problem, then who will?

1383
01:35:55,485 --> 01:35:57,526
- Continue.
- Yes, absolutely.

1384
01:35:57,527 --> 01:35:59,859
To figure out the problem
we have to do a test.

1385
01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:01,901
- I'll say a word.
- Okay.

1386
01:36:01,902 --> 01:36:05,984
And you have to say the first
thing that comes to your mind.

1387
01:36:06,068 --> 01:36:07,567
Without deliberating.

1388
01:36:07,568 --> 01:36:08,859
- Alright?
- Okay.

1389
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:10,693
- Ready, doctor.
- Fine.

1390
01:36:10,986 --> 01:36:11,943
Car.

1391
01:36:12,236 --> 01:36:13,110
Road.

1392
01:36:13,111 --> 01:36:14,069
Arjun.

1393
01:36:14,445 --> 01:36:15,278
Brother.

1394
01:36:15,529 --> 01:36:16,319
Diary.

1395
01:36:16,445 --> 01:36:17,236
Poetry.

1396
01:36:17,237 --> 01:36:18,069
Heart.

1397
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:18,736
Love.

1398
01:36:18,862 --> 01:36:19,694
Mumbai.

1399
01:36:19,695 --> 01:36:20,528
Traffic.

1400
01:36:20,529 --> 01:36:21,569
Father.

1401
01:36:23,362 --> 01:36:24,319
- Father?
- Mother.

1402
01:36:27,529 --> 01:36:29,611
According to my test...

1403
01:36:29,695 --> 01:36:32,569
your father is the root
of your emotional problem.

1404
01:36:32,570 --> 01:36:34,028
And you're keeping this from the world.

1405
01:36:35,862 --> 01:36:38,944
And, in my opinion, Dr. Sigmund Fraud...

1406
01:36:38,945 --> 01:36:42,819
it's time to shred your degree.
Please stop practicing, please!

1407
01:36:42,904 --> 01:36:44,528
You hurt my feelings, man.

1408
01:36:55,863 --> 01:36:56,862
My bwoys!

1409
01:36:57,780 --> 01:37:00,238
If you want a view, look that way.

1410
01:37:09,156 --> 01:37:10,988
We should talk to him.

1411
01:37:17,739 --> 01:37:20,905
Natasha is really sweet. It
was really nice to meet her.

1412
01:37:20,906 --> 01:37:24,696
Yeah... even she was
glad to have met you.

1413
01:37:27,781 --> 01:37:28,988
Kabir...

1414
01:37:31,364 --> 01:37:33,863
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

1415
01:37:37,865 --> 01:37:40,906
Why... are you asking like this?

1416
01:37:43,949 --> 01:37:45,948
I don't know man. Listen...

1417
01:37:46,908 --> 01:37:48,865
it's possible I may be wrong.

1418
01:37:50,116 --> 01:37:53,990
But, we are friends.
And I just...

1419
01:37:54,074 --> 01:37:54,990
I just have to ask you.

1420
01:37:57,116 --> 01:38:00,073
Are you happy with Natasha?

1421
01:38:01,366 --> 01:38:05,615
Dude, you just met her. And
the poor girl was a bit tense.

1422
01:38:06,324 --> 01:38:09,032
She thought there was something
between Laila and me.

1423
01:38:10,699 --> 01:38:11,573
Yeah.

1424
01:38:12,241 --> 01:38:15,282
But, now there's no problem.
Thanks to you, my bwoys!

1425
01:38:16,366 --> 01:38:17,657
Okay?

1426
01:38:17,741 --> 01:38:18,991
She's sweet.

1427
01:38:19,367 --> 01:38:20,949
Imran, you've met her.
You spent time with her.

1428
01:38:21,034 --> 01:38:21,866
Tell him.

1429
01:38:22,367 --> 01:38:23,741
Yes, she is very sweet.

1430
01:38:27,867 --> 01:38:28,950
Well that's good, man.

1431
01:38:28,951 --> 01:38:29,950
I'm happy for you.

1432
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:37,075
Hey... here's an extra pillow!

1433
01:38:42,326 --> 01:38:43,534
Good night, bwoys.

1434
01:38:44,785 --> 01:38:45,992
Good night.

1435
01:39:00,744 --> 01:39:04,160
Guys, do you mind if we take a detour?

1436
01:39:05,244 --> 01:39:05,951
Why?

1437
01:39:06,536 --> 01:39:08,326
There is an artist, Salman Habib.

1438
01:39:08,536 --> 01:39:11,743
He lives around here. The
lady at the gallery told me.

1439
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:13,827
That he sells his paintings from home.

1440
01:39:14,453 --> 01:39:15,411
Really?

1441
01:39:16,537 --> 01:39:17,411
Sounds good.

1442
01:39:17,495 --> 01:39:19,869
Anyway, I'm a bit bored hanging
with just the two of you.

1443
01:39:37,078 --> 01:39:40,744
The map says we should take
the next right for Grazalema.

1444
01:39:41,078 --> 01:39:42,452
- Salman Habib.

1445
01:39:42,453 --> 01:39:44,620
- You'll find Indians in
every corner of the world.

1446
01:39:45,288 --> 01:39:47,328
- Really, man.
We're everywhere!

1447
01:39:48,704 --> 01:39:50,453
Grazalema. Turn right over here.

1448
01:39:58,580 --> 01:40:01,996
- Dude, I said right.
- Forget it.

1449
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:05,746
Don't feel like it.
Let's go to Seville.

1450
01:40:05,747 --> 01:40:07,996
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1451
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:10,079
We can go on the way back.
It's okay.

1452
01:40:11,455 --> 01:40:12,413
Okay!

1453
01:40:13,580 --> 01:40:17,413
It's time to see what
I've planned for us.

1454
01:40:22,955 --> 01:40:24,913
Check it out, bwoys!

1455
01:40:26,165 --> 01:40:28,539
Look at that guys!

1456
01:40:29,748 --> 01:40:32,622
- Arjun, my pal. You rock!
- Look at that dude!

1457
01:40:32,706 --> 01:40:34,164
- Wow!
- You b******!

1458
01:40:34,915 --> 01:40:36,455
You're purposely doing this.

1459
01:40:36,456 --> 01:40:38,080
You know I'm scared of heights.

1460
01:40:38,081 --> 01:40:39,372
Don't be silly.

1461
01:40:39,873 --> 01:40:41,539
I want to do this.
It's my dream.

1462
01:40:41,623 --> 01:40:43,165
- Yeah right!
- Just imagine...

1463
01:40:43,916 --> 01:40:47,040
jumping from 15,000 feet and
flying towards the earth.

1464
01:40:47,666 --> 01:40:49,165
That's not flying, that's falling.

1465
01:40:50,124 --> 01:40:51,081
It will be fun.

1466
01:40:51,582 --> 01:40:52,540
Relax.

1467
01:40:52,666 --> 01:40:54,665
Remember he eventually enjoyed diving.

1468
01:40:54,666 --> 01:40:55,331
- Correct.
- Big deal.

1469
01:40:55,332 --> 01:40:57,790
With a beautiful instructor
like Laila, who wouldn't!

1470
01:40:58,332 --> 01:41:00,165
You never know, you
also might get lucky.

1471
01:41:00,666 --> 01:41:04,081
You people ready to jump out of a plane?

1472
01:41:04,082 --> 01:41:05,081
- Oh yeah!

1473
01:41:05,124 --> 01:41:07,831
Are you ready to enter the air?

1474
01:41:08,041 --> 01:41:09,041
Yeah!

1475
01:41:12,458 --> 01:41:14,957
Head up. Eyes to the horizon.

1476
01:41:14,958 --> 01:41:16,624
Legs at 45 degrees.

1477
01:41:17,125 --> 01:41:19,374
Arch! Arch!

1478
01:41:23,167 --> 01:41:24,666
- Did I say relax?
- No.

1479
01:41:25,125 --> 01:41:28,792
I said arch.
I didn't say relax.

1480
01:41:40,876 --> 01:41:42,292
These are total maIfunctions.

1481
01:41:42,918 --> 01:41:45,875
In case of a total maIfunction
what you have to do is this.

1482
01:41:45,876 --> 01:41:48,083
Cut away your main and
deploy your reserve.

1483
01:41:48,418 --> 01:41:49,958
What is that?
You have a maIfunction.

1484
01:41:53,085 --> 01:41:55,126
Cut away my main and deploy my reserve.

1485
01:41:55,127 --> 01:41:56,543
What are you doing?

1486
01:41:57,335 --> 01:41:59,959
- It's a broken line.
- Are you sure it's a broken line?

1487
01:42:00,877 --> 01:42:04,084
Scissor kick... scissor kick...

1488
01:42:04,794 --> 01:42:06,084
Cut! Deploy!

1489
01:42:07,085 --> 01:42:07,918
Perfect!

1490
01:42:12,961 --> 01:42:13,544
What's this?

1491
01:42:14,086 --> 01:42:15,002
Waiver form.

1492
01:42:15,003 --> 01:42:15,669
Waiver form?

1493
01:42:15,753 --> 01:42:18,919
If something happens to us... like
death, these guys aren't responsible.

1494
01:42:19,003 --> 01:42:20,710
We are responsible for it.

1495
01:42:20,711 --> 01:42:21,377
What?

1496
01:42:25,128 --> 01:42:26,127
I'll see you outside.

1497
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:03,921
- I'm feeling sick.
- What?

1498
01:43:05,463 --> 01:43:06,921
I'm going to throw up.

1499
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:11,754
I'm scared too.

1500
01:43:12,088 --> 01:43:13,879
But that's why we are here.

1501
01:43:16,131 --> 01:43:17,838
Everybody get ready.

1502
01:43:17,964 --> 01:43:19,172
Okay!

1503
01:43:27,881 --> 01:43:29,963
Alright, guys.
This is it!

1504
01:43:50,549 --> 01:43:51,548
Bye!

1505
01:43:57,507 --> 01:43:58,590
Dude!

1506
01:43:58,925 --> 01:43:59,882
I'm next.

1507
01:44:01,883 --> 01:44:03,090
Adios amigo!

1508
01:44:04,966 --> 01:44:06,174
See you downstairs!

1509
01:44:20,300 --> 01:44:21,299
Let go, Imran.

1510
01:44:23,550 --> 01:44:25,174
Just let it all go!

1511
01:44:55,093 --> 01:44:56,342
Push me!

1512
01:45:52,679 --> 01:45:53,886
Come on, Imran!

1513
01:45:56,930 --> 01:45:58,095
Imran!

1514
01:48:21,312 --> 01:48:24,977
Who are you?
Where have you been?

1515
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:27,977
I've moved the heaven and the
earth but I couldn't find you

1516
01:48:29,270 --> 01:48:32,686
But you arrive today, so suddenly

1517
01:48:33,187 --> 01:48:36,186
And you give meaning to
my whole life with your love

1518
01:48:37,103 --> 01:48:38,644
I don't understand

1519
01:48:39,062 --> 01:48:40,894
I don't know

1520
01:48:41,103 --> 01:48:43,936
What you've said to me, Senorita

1521
01:48:44,812 --> 01:48:48,144
Even then, I have no idea why

1522
01:48:49,103 --> 01:48:52,102
I like what I heard, Senorita

1523
01:49:02,730 --> 01:49:04,896
Don't look away

1524
01:49:06,814 --> 01:49:08,979
Stay close to me

1525
01:49:10,605 --> 01:49:13,063
Take me in your arms

1526
01:49:13,772 --> 01:49:16,396
Hope you've understood Senorita

1527
01:49:17,397 --> 01:49:20,563
Even a few moments of love

1528
01:49:22,064 --> 01:49:24,938
Are never too less

1529
01:49:24,939 --> 01:49:28,104
Come let's lose ourselves in them

1530
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:32,146
And forget we ever knew sadness

1531
01:49:32,230 --> 01:49:35,979
Senorita, listen to us Senorita,
d'you hear what we're saying

1532
01:49:36,980 --> 01:49:40,105
I will never understand

1533
01:49:40,940 --> 01:49:43,981
The meaning of the
words you dedicate to me

1534
01:49:44,691 --> 01:49:47,648
But the warmth of your gaze

1535
01:49:48,941 --> 01:49:51,981
Makes me feel like
the most beautiful Senorita

1536
01:49:52,482 --> 01:49:56,773
Our eyes looked at each other

1537
01:49:56,774 --> 01:49:59,648
And recounted tales of desire Senorita

1538
01:50:00,274 --> 01:50:04,023
That for affection and for love

1539
01:50:04,316 --> 01:50:08,690
There is only one language
in the world Senorita

1540
01:50:09,066 --> 01:50:11,565
Don't look away from me now

1541
01:50:12,941 --> 01:50:15,106
Come closer to me

1542
01:50:16,899 --> 01:50:19,690
Take me in your arms

1543
01:50:19,982 --> 01:50:23,399
Hope you've understood Senorita

1544
01:50:23,483 --> 01:50:27,067
Even a few moments of love

1545
01:50:28,484 --> 01:50:30,942
Are never too less

1546
01:50:31,401 --> 01:50:35,150
Come let's lose ourselves in them

1547
01:50:36,276 --> 01:50:38,733
And forget we ever know sadness

1548
01:50:38,734 --> 01:50:42,942
Senorita, listen to us Senorita,
d'you hear what we're saying

1549
01:50:51,526 --> 01:50:54,108
With every moment that has passed

1550
01:50:55,901 --> 01:50:58,150
Oh Senorita

1551
01:51:00,026 --> 01:51:02,817
You've managed to win my heart

1552
01:51:03,068 --> 01:51:04,901
And that's all there is to it

1553
01:51:05,777 --> 01:51:07,818
Don't look away

1554
01:51:09,694 --> 01:51:11,902
Stay close to me

1555
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:15,777
Take me in your arms

1556
01:51:16,778 --> 01:51:19,735
Hope you've understood Senorita

1557
01:51:20,111 --> 01:51:23,110
Even a few moments of love

1558
01:51:24,986 --> 01:51:27,027
Are never too less

1559
01:51:28,111 --> 01:51:31,527
Come let's lose ourselves in them

1560
01:51:32,986 --> 01:51:35,152
And forget we ever knew sadness

1561
01:51:35,445 --> 01:51:39,027
Even a few moments of love

1562
01:51:40,278 --> 01:51:43,444
Are never too less

1563
01:51:43,570 --> 01:51:46,820
Come let's lose ourselves in them

1564
01:51:48,112 --> 01:51:51,111
And forget we ever knew sadness

1565
01:52:14,738 --> 01:52:17,446
Remember before cable TV we
only had one national channel?

1566
01:52:19,738 --> 01:52:22,154
And every Sunday they
showed a Hindi film.

1567
01:52:23,697 --> 01:52:25,196
Get to the point.

1568
01:52:26,822 --> 01:52:27,821
The point is...

1569
01:52:28,698 --> 01:52:30,738
before the film there
was this animation.

1570
01:52:31,823 --> 01:52:34,155
A white circle went round and
round and formed the channel logo.

1571
01:52:36,948 --> 01:52:37,947
Do you remember the tune?

1572
01:52:58,199 --> 01:52:58,948
Brilliant!

1573
01:53:10,908 --> 01:53:13,032
That tune never failed to depress me.

1574
01:53:14,116 --> 01:53:15,115
Depressed.

1575
01:53:17,033 --> 01:53:18,657
I'm feeling the same right now.

1576
01:53:21,825 --> 01:53:23,949
Weekend's over and school begins.

1577
01:53:24,241 --> 01:53:27,158
- And you wanted to cancel this trip!
- I know, man!

1578
01:53:27,159 --> 01:53:28,450
Can you imagine?

1579
01:53:32,492 --> 01:53:33,616
You know what that means?

1580
01:53:34,992 --> 01:53:36,241
It means...

1581
01:53:37,492 --> 01:53:39,700
that everything is predestined.

1582
01:53:42,284 --> 01:53:43,366
Everything!

1583
01:53:44,492 --> 01:53:48,075
This holiday was in our destiny.

1584
01:53:49,076 --> 01:53:50,033
You know!

1585
01:53:53,034 --> 01:53:54,784
You, me and asshole.

1586
01:53:55,910 --> 01:53:57,742
- Cheers asshole.
- Where's asshole?

1587
01:53:59,910 --> 01:54:00,326
Cheers!

1588
01:54:03,202 --> 01:54:04,784
Laila too.

1589
01:54:08,910 --> 01:54:11,035
I was meant to meet her.

1590
01:54:12,203 --> 01:54:13,660
You are in love, my bwoy.

1591
01:54:14,411 --> 01:54:15,577
No, man!

1592
01:54:15,953 --> 01:54:17,410
You are in love...

1593
01:54:18,078 --> 01:54:19,410
- You are in love...

1594
01:54:19,411 --> 01:54:22,243
- You are in love...
- Kabir, man!

1595
01:54:22,328 --> 01:54:24,785
Everything is written. Listen to me.

1596
01:54:25,036 --> 01:54:26,410
It's all predestined.

1597
01:54:26,703 --> 01:54:27,493
You know what I'm saying?

1598
01:54:27,494 --> 01:54:29,702
This moment... us right now...

1599
01:54:29,703 --> 01:54:31,035
it's predestined.

1600
01:54:31,036 --> 01:54:32,743
Predestined.

1601
01:54:33,453 --> 01:54:35,493
Please stop saying, 'predestined...'!

1602
01:54:35,870 --> 01:54:37,286
I beg of you!

1603
01:54:37,912 --> 01:54:40,328
This too is predestined.
It's all written.

1604
01:54:40,329 --> 01:54:42,328
Alright, we get it.

1605
01:54:42,329 --> 01:54:44,203
Listen, we get it, zip!

1606
01:54:44,287 --> 01:54:45,494
Come on, man!

1607
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:48,078
It's true.

1608
01:54:49,204 --> 01:54:50,411
It's predestined...

1609
01:54:50,412 --> 01:54:51,286
Guys...

1610
01:55:16,288 --> 01:55:17,870
Guys, watch out!

1611
01:55:20,622 --> 01:55:21,705
What the hell, guys?

1612
01:55:28,539 --> 01:55:29,288
Yes?

1613
01:55:44,998 --> 01:55:47,831
- Our man is back.
- Their mobiles are switched off.

1614
01:55:47,832 --> 01:55:48,789
- What?
- Yup.

1615
01:55:48,915 --> 01:55:50,039
Even Nuria's?

1616
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:51,456
Yes, I'm shocked.

1617
01:55:51,582 --> 01:55:54,664
When she knew we'd land up in jail, she
should've kept the phone switched on

1618
01:55:56,123 --> 01:55:58,122
If our bail isn't posted...

1619
01:55:58,123 --> 01:56:00,539
we'll be stuck here for days.

1620
01:56:05,083 --> 01:56:05,915
Arjun...

1621
01:56:07,749 --> 01:56:09,498
tell them I want to make a call.

1622
01:56:10,541 --> 01:56:11,707
To whom?

1623
01:56:12,791 --> 01:56:14,082
Salman Habib.

1624
01:56:14,458 --> 01:56:15,498
The artist?

1625
01:56:17,333 --> 01:56:17,915
Yeah.

1626
01:56:19,416 --> 01:56:21,123
Why will he come to post our bail?

1627
01:56:23,124 --> 01:56:24,040
Are you alright?

1628
01:56:24,916 --> 01:56:27,416
Just because we can't reach
anyone, he's losing it.

1629
01:56:27,417 --> 01:56:28,499
He's my father.

1630
01:56:29,334 --> 01:56:29,958
What?

1631
01:56:32,542 --> 01:56:33,708
I am his son.

1632
01:56:44,126 --> 01:56:45,125
Just let it go Imran.

1633
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:49,042
Just let it go.

1634
01:56:49,501 --> 01:56:50,084
- Hello...

1635
01:56:51,585 --> 01:56:53,042
Hello, may l...

1636
01:56:53,043 --> 01:56:54,959
speak with Mr. Salman Habib, please?

1637
01:56:55,918 --> 01:56:56,584
- Yes?

1638
01:56:58,126 --> 01:57:00,042
Sir, I am Imran.

1639
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:04,334
I am Rahila's son.

1640
01:57:08,710 --> 01:57:10,043
When did you find out?

1641
01:57:13,419 --> 01:57:15,293
A few days after Abu died.

1642
01:57:18,044 --> 01:57:21,626
In his stuff, I found a letter
that Ammi had written to him.

1643
01:57:22,919 --> 01:57:24,835
The letter stated that...

1644
01:57:24,961 --> 01:57:30,586
Ammi was grateful that Abu had
accepted her and her unborn child.

1645
01:57:34,003 --> 01:57:35,461
Why didn't you tell us?

1646
01:57:38,503 --> 01:57:39,919
I was a bit shaken up.

1647
01:57:41,587 --> 01:57:44,002
What would I tell you?
Abu is not my father.

1648
01:57:46,795 --> 01:57:48,752
He loved you a lot.

1649
01:57:50,170 --> 01:57:51,961
He really loved you.

1650
01:57:53,878 --> 01:57:55,045
And us.

1651
01:57:55,921 --> 01:57:57,962
I mean, think about it.

1652
01:57:57,963 --> 01:58:00,378
Be it sports day or
parent-teacher meetings...

1653
01:58:00,379 --> 01:58:03,795
our fathers seldom came,
but Abu was always there.

1654
01:58:05,338 --> 01:58:07,587
Well, my father was dead.

1655
01:58:07,963 --> 01:58:11,379
So, if he showed up for sports day
it would've been a bit strange.

1656
01:58:18,297 --> 01:58:19,796
- You've got bail.

1657
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:24,254
They're here.

1658
01:58:35,922 --> 01:58:37,004
Hi.

1659
01:58:40,048 --> 01:58:40,797
Imran.

1660
01:58:43,048 --> 01:58:44,005
Imran...

1661
01:58:45,090 --> 01:58:46,005
I'm Salman.

1662
01:58:50,756 --> 01:58:52,840
My friends, Arjun and Kabir.

1663
01:58:52,841 --> 01:58:53,923
- Hello.
- Thank you.

1664
01:58:53,924 --> 01:58:55,298
Hi... thank you.

1665
01:58:56,216 --> 01:58:58,215
You three look pretty hungover.

1666
01:59:01,591 --> 01:59:04,340
You're welcome to come over
to my place and freshen up.

1667
01:59:04,966 --> 01:59:07,840
Our bags and car are at the hotel.

1668
01:59:08,132 --> 01:59:09,381
I'll drive you there.

1669
01:59:11,174 --> 01:59:12,048
Come.

1670
01:59:27,008 --> 01:59:29,049
- Wow, this is beautiful.

1671
01:59:30,717 --> 01:59:31,757
It's really nice.

1672
01:59:33,008 --> 01:59:35,008
Are you always so polite?

1673
01:59:36,634 --> 01:59:39,967
It's absolute rubbish.
Anyone can do that.

1674
01:59:40,759 --> 01:59:43,133
This gentleman, my neighbour...

1675
01:59:43,134 --> 01:59:46,383
was obsessed with having his
wife immortalised in a portrait.

1676
01:59:46,384 --> 01:59:50,050
So, I applied my brush
and fuIfilled his desire.

1677
01:59:50,134 --> 01:59:52,300
And with his money, paid my bills.

1678
01:59:54,759 --> 01:59:56,925
So, what are you guys doing in Seville?

1679
01:59:57,801 --> 01:59:59,008
Skydiving.

1680
01:59:59,009 --> 02:00:00,217
- Really?
- Yeah.

1681
02:00:00,301 --> 02:00:02,467
So, you jumped out of a
plane and landed in jail?

1682
02:00:03,801 --> 02:00:05,008
You could say that.

1683
02:00:05,593 --> 02:00:09,759
That apart, what do you do?

1684
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:12,259
Well, I'm a financial broker.

1685
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:13,718
In London.

1686
02:00:14,094 --> 02:00:15,134
Money man.

1687
02:00:16,720 --> 02:00:17,385
And you?

1688
02:00:17,928 --> 02:00:19,802
My family is in the
construction business.

1689
02:00:20,845 --> 02:00:23,052
Well, never mind.
Everyone makes mistakes.

1690
02:00:24,011 --> 02:00:25,010
That's funny.

1691
02:00:25,553 --> 02:00:27,552
You're a Xerox copy of him.

1692
02:00:31,178 --> 02:00:33,052
And, what about you?

1693
02:00:34,303 --> 02:00:35,177
I write.

1694
02:00:37,011 --> 02:00:37,469
What?

1695
02:00:38,303 --> 02:00:39,969
I'm a copywriter in advertising.

1696
02:00:41,053 --> 02:00:44,135
Writing copy for ads is like
a buffet for the masses.

1697
02:00:44,636 --> 02:00:47,219
For instance, this painting
is for someone else.

1698
02:00:48,803 --> 02:00:51,552
Do you write anything
to feed your own soul?

1699
02:00:53,178 --> 02:00:54,595
I do.

1700
02:00:59,347 --> 02:00:59,971
Sir?

1701
02:01:00,180 --> 02:01:00,971
Salman.

1702
02:01:01,847 --> 02:01:03,512
Right. We'll be outside.

1703
02:01:21,138 --> 02:01:24,096
Your hands are very similar to mine.

1704
02:01:27,597 --> 02:01:28,554
Sit.

1705
02:01:32,222 --> 02:01:33,096
Do you live alone?

1706
02:01:33,722 --> 02:01:34,679
No.

1707
02:01:35,305 --> 02:01:36,137
I have a wife.

1708
02:01:36,597 --> 02:01:38,762
But she is away... in Paris.

1709
02:01:39,138 --> 02:01:40,013
Sit.

1710
02:01:43,140 --> 02:01:44,056
And any...

1711
02:01:44,099 --> 02:01:45,306
children?

1712
02:01:52,057 --> 02:01:53,056
Do you ever come to India?

1713
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:55,223
Yes.

1714
02:01:55,224 --> 02:01:58,056
I was there four years ago
when my mother passed away.

1715
02:01:59,515 --> 02:02:01,139
- Sorry.
- I have a brother there...

1716
02:02:01,140 --> 02:02:02,098
but...

1717
02:02:03,849 --> 02:02:04,973
we don't meet.

1718
02:02:10,724 --> 02:02:12,931
I've often thought about you.

1719
02:02:15,140 --> 02:02:15,931
I mean...

1720
02:02:17,515 --> 02:02:22,098
that someday, somewhere we might meet.

1721
02:02:23,683 --> 02:02:26,016
But I never figured...

1722
02:02:26,017 --> 02:02:28,683
what I would say to you.

1723
02:02:30,309 --> 02:02:31,516
Just say the truth.

1724
02:02:34,226 --> 02:02:36,475
The truth... what is the truth?

1725
02:02:37,767 --> 02:02:40,225
Everyone has their own version.

1726
02:02:45,642 --> 02:02:47,850
Look... I was...

1727
02:02:47,851 --> 02:02:49,683
25 then.

1728
02:02:50,892 --> 02:02:53,850
Rahila was a few years younger.

1729
02:02:55,101 --> 02:02:58,058
When you're young the
future doesn't matter.

1730
02:02:58,059 --> 02:02:59,558
We were just kids.

1731
02:03:02,142 --> 02:03:04,183
One day...

1732
02:03:04,309 --> 02:03:06,892
Rahila told me that she's...

1733
02:03:07,435 --> 02:03:10,268
expecting a baby.

1734
02:03:10,353 --> 02:03:13,227
I wasn't ready for the
responsibility then.

1735
02:03:13,311 --> 02:03:15,185
And nor am I now.

1736
02:03:21,811 --> 02:03:24,727
So... you just abandoned her?

1737
02:03:28,561 --> 02:03:31,560
I guess, you could say that.

1738
02:03:36,811 --> 02:03:41,227
Rahila wanted a family,
she wanted to be a mother.

1739
02:03:42,603 --> 02:03:45,143
I had other dreams.
I wanted to be an artist.

1740
02:03:46,144 --> 02:03:48,143
I wanted to paint...

1741
02:03:48,144 --> 02:03:49,728
travel the world.

1742
02:03:51,145 --> 02:03:53,644
I loved her but...

1743
02:03:53,645 --> 02:03:56,687
she made her choice and I made mine.

1744
02:03:56,771 --> 02:03:58,520
That's all.

1745
02:04:02,396 --> 02:04:04,687
I found out about you only last year.

1746
02:04:08,646 --> 02:04:09,604
But...

1747
02:04:11,230 --> 02:04:14,020
you've always known about me.

1748
02:04:15,813 --> 02:04:18,395
Did you never want to see me?

1749
02:04:20,563 --> 02:04:22,437
I thought it was better this way.

1750
02:04:30,396 --> 02:04:33,021
You asked for the truth.

1751
02:04:34,272 --> 02:04:35,438
Well, this is it.

1752
02:04:36,772 --> 02:04:37,771
Okay.

1753
02:04:38,147 --> 02:04:39,564
I... am sorry, Imran.

1754
02:04:41,523 --> 02:04:42,522
No, you're not.

1755
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:49,939
Is there something I can do for you?

1756
02:04:51,398 --> 02:04:54,397
Apologise only when it comes from here.

1757
02:05:17,733 --> 02:05:20,690
When clouds of pain loom in the sky

1758
02:05:21,316 --> 02:05:24,274
When a shadow of sadness flickers by

1759
02:05:25,025 --> 02:05:27,983
When a tear finds it's way to the eye

1760
02:05:28,442 --> 02:05:31,399
When fear keeps the loneliness alive

1761
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:36,941
I try and console my heart
Why is it that you cry? I ask

1762
02:05:36,942 --> 02:05:39,608
This is only what life imparts

1763
02:05:40,275 --> 02:05:42,774
These deep silences within

1764
02:05:43,150 --> 02:05:45,941
Have been handed out to all by time

1765
02:05:47,025 --> 02:05:49,608
Everyone's story has a little sorrow

1766
02:05:50,109 --> 02:05:52,941
Everyone's share has a little Sunshine

1767
02:05:54,150 --> 02:05:56,234
No need for water in your eyes

1768
02:05:57,735 --> 02:06:00,109
Every moment can be a new life

1769
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:03,609
Why do you let them pass you by

1770
02:06:04,943 --> 02:06:07,150
Oh heart, why is it that you cry?

1771
02:06:16,194 --> 02:06:17,401
Morning...

1772
02:06:23,736 --> 02:06:24,735
Did you sleep or not?

1773
02:06:26,319 --> 02:06:26,985
No.

1774
02:06:36,194 --> 02:06:38,986
I think, we should get going.

1775
02:06:40,612 --> 02:06:41,611
Let's go.

1776
02:06:43,153 --> 02:06:43,694
Arjun...

1777
02:06:47,903 --> 02:06:49,694
I'm really sorry.

1778
02:07:14,571 --> 02:07:15,653
I'll see you at the car.

1779
02:07:15,946 --> 02:07:16,737
Yeah.

1780
02:07:20,904 --> 02:07:22,779
What do you mean,
'you slept in the car'?

1781
02:07:23,489 --> 02:07:24,863
Long story, babe.

1782
02:07:25,989 --> 02:07:26,988
Tell me, what happened?

1783
02:07:28,114 --> 02:07:30,071
Well, Imran just...

1784
02:07:31,989 --> 02:07:33,196
I'll tell you later, okay.

1785
02:07:34,030 --> 02:07:35,946
Why? Tell me now, what happened?

1786
02:07:36,114 --> 02:07:39,072
I can't tell you right now.
I'll tell you when I'm back.

1787
02:07:39,531 --> 02:07:41,114
Why are you getting irritated?

1788
02:07:41,198 --> 02:07:43,030
Why are you going on about it?

1789
02:07:43,323 --> 02:07:44,697
Okay, forget it.

1790
02:07:48,990 --> 02:07:50,155
See.

1791
02:07:50,365 --> 02:07:52,155
It's our wedding card.
Can you see it?

1792
02:07:52,406 --> 02:07:53,905
Isn't it gorgeous?

1793
02:07:54,323 --> 02:07:56,114
I'm just so happy with it.

1794
02:07:56,906 --> 02:07:59,447
Oh... I've emailed a few
options for your suit.

1795
02:07:59,448 --> 02:08:02,030
Please select one.
Okay? Don't forget.

1796
02:08:02,656 --> 02:08:03,531
Okay.

1797
02:08:05,824 --> 02:08:08,073
You are so far away.

1798
02:08:09,199 --> 02:08:10,781
You love me, right?

1799
02:08:11,991 --> 02:08:12,948
Yeah.

1800
02:08:13,824 --> 02:08:15,656
Then stop fighting with me.

1801
02:08:16,449 --> 02:08:19,615
Everything was fine before
you went on this holiday.

1802
02:08:20,199 --> 02:08:21,948
Kabir, just come home.

1803
02:08:22,574 --> 02:08:26,116
To me, your family, your friends.

1804
02:08:26,367 --> 02:08:28,116
My friends are with me.

1805
02:08:28,492 --> 02:08:30,449
Yeah, I know.
But you know what I mean.

1806
02:08:41,950 --> 02:08:49,075
Happy birthday to you...

1807
02:08:50,034 --> 02:08:53,575
Happy birthday dear Anjali...

1808
02:08:54,159 --> 02:08:56,825
Happy birthday to you...

1809
02:09:01,993 --> 02:09:03,325
What a beautifuI cake.

1810
02:09:03,368 --> 02:09:04,242
Oh my God!

1811
02:09:05,326 --> 02:09:06,533
It's beautiful!

1812
02:09:07,034 --> 02:09:08,075
- Nice, right?
- Yes!

1813
02:09:09,994 --> 02:09:11,076
Tanya?

1814
02:09:20,994 --> 02:09:22,201
What are you doing, baby?

1815
02:09:22,952 --> 02:09:24,201
I'm sorry, I'm so happy.

1816
02:09:24,785 --> 02:09:27,076
Kabir just proposed to Natasha.

1817
02:09:27,160 --> 02:09:28,201
- What
- What?

1818
02:09:28,202 --> 02:09:30,202
Oh my God!

1819
02:09:30,203 --> 02:09:33,035
You could've waited until
your mother had cut the cake.

1820
02:09:33,036 --> 02:09:36,035
Kabir, this is the best
birthday gift, ever!

1821
02:09:36,120 --> 02:09:36,994
I love you, son.

1822
02:09:36,995 --> 02:09:38,077
- The shy guy!

1823
02:09:38,953 --> 02:09:41,077
- It's a double celebration.

1824
02:09:41,078 --> 02:09:42,410
I'm so happy.

1825
02:09:43,120 --> 02:09:44,077
Now you have to call me 'mummy'.

1826
02:09:45,745 --> 02:09:47,577
- Get some champagne!

1827
02:09:50,203 --> 02:09:50,827
Come here.

1828
02:09:53,204 --> 02:09:54,703
Very good decision.

1829
02:09:56,996 --> 02:09:58,953
I'm so happy.

1830
02:10:00,037 --> 02:10:02,703
Babe, what just happened in there?

1831
02:10:02,787 --> 02:10:05,161
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

1832
02:10:05,537 --> 02:10:07,203
This ring...

1833
02:10:07,204 --> 02:10:08,703
I got it for my mom.

1834
02:10:10,704 --> 02:10:12,454
It's her birthday gift.

1835
02:10:12,997 --> 02:10:14,037
This is for your mom?

1836
02:10:14,872 --> 02:10:17,704
Look at it sweety...
it's a mummy ring.

1837
02:10:17,788 --> 02:10:19,037
What?

1838
02:10:19,038 --> 02:10:20,496
Why didn't you say something?

1839
02:10:21,080 --> 02:10:22,496
I tried.

1840
02:10:22,580 --> 02:10:26,454
But you were excited and screaming.
And Tanya made an announcement.

1841
02:10:27,038 --> 02:10:29,246
So you don't want to marry me?

1842
02:10:29,788 --> 02:10:33,204
It's not about you. I haven't
even thought about marriage.

1843
02:10:36,038 --> 02:10:37,787
What do I tell my father?

1844
02:10:42,748 --> 02:10:45,663
We'll say that we gave
it some more thought and...

1845
02:10:45,664 --> 02:10:47,997
we need more time.
That's all.

1846
02:10:47,998 --> 02:10:49,747
This is so embarrassing.

1847
02:10:50,581 --> 02:10:52,622
I'm so sorry, sweety.

1848
02:10:53,582 --> 02:10:56,206
You don't ever want to marry me?

1849
02:10:57,540 --> 02:10:59,331
It's not like that.

1850
02:10:59,332 --> 02:11:01,998
If it is, you better tell me right now!

1851
02:11:03,124 --> 02:11:05,998
I really love you, Kabir.
And I don't...

1852
02:11:05,999 --> 02:11:09,039
No, no... no sweety.
Don't cry.

1853
02:11:09,124 --> 02:11:10,039
Not now.

1854
02:11:17,540 --> 02:11:18,164
Kabir...

1855
02:11:20,124 --> 02:11:23,957
are you even serious about
this relationship or not?

1856
02:11:27,166 --> 02:11:27,957
You know what...

1857
02:11:39,001 --> 02:11:40,041
Will you marry me?

1858
02:12:04,209 --> 02:12:05,291
Who is it?

1859
02:12:20,128 --> 02:12:20,960
Room service.

1860
02:12:22,211 --> 02:12:23,002
Laila?

1861
02:12:24,044 --> 02:12:24,960
Hi!

1862
02:12:24,961 --> 02:12:25,960
Oh my God!

1863
02:12:27,253 --> 02:12:28,835
You're here... how... I mean...

1864
02:12:29,128 --> 02:12:32,002
Imran called and he begged me to come.

1865
02:12:32,169 --> 02:12:33,418
- So I came.
- Imran?

1866
02:12:34,003 --> 02:12:35,043
I knew it.

1867
02:12:35,628 --> 02:12:37,085
He is my best friend.

1868
02:12:40,253 --> 02:12:42,460
I am... so glad you're here.

1869
02:12:44,003 --> 02:12:45,585
I'm glad you are glad.

1870
02:12:48,169 --> 02:12:50,377
Hello... my the two the love the birds!

1871
02:12:50,961 --> 02:12:52,127
Hello!

1872
02:12:52,294 --> 02:12:53,378
Surprised, Arjun?

1873
02:12:54,754 --> 02:12:55,836
Thank you.

1874
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:57,169
It's good to see you.

1875
02:12:57,170 --> 02:12:58,419
- And you.
- Hey gorgeous.

1876
02:12:58,545 --> 02:13:00,628
- I love you too.
- Nice to have you back.

1877
02:13:00,629 --> 02:13:02,087
You got a tan!

1878
02:13:02,796 --> 02:13:03,795
Get dressed, soon!

1879
02:13:03,796 --> 02:13:04,962
- We had to leave at seven.
- Correct.

1880
02:13:04,963 --> 02:13:06,212
- Two minutes?
- You missed me?

1881
02:13:06,213 --> 02:13:08,045
I always miss you, darling.

1882
02:13:08,046 --> 02:13:09,087
Where are we going?

1883
02:13:09,171 --> 02:13:10,712
It's a surprise. Can't
tell you in front of him.

1884
02:13:28,755 --> 02:13:29,962
What's going on?

1885
02:13:30,213 --> 02:13:31,295
What do you mean?

1886
02:13:31,630 --> 02:13:32,670
It's San Fermin.

1887
02:13:32,796 --> 02:13:33,837
Running with the bulls.

1888
02:13:33,838 --> 02:13:35,087
- Really?
- Didn't you know?

1889
02:13:35,171 --> 02:13:36,295
Just follow me...

1890
02:13:44,673 --> 02:13:45,756
Holy shit!

1891
02:13:52,798 --> 02:13:54,339
Are these guys mad?
What are they doing?

1892
02:13:54,632 --> 02:13:55,381
Suicide.

1893
02:13:56,048 --> 02:13:57,256
Isn't that why you are here?

1894
02:14:08,173 --> 02:14:09,964
I feIt this should be the
last experience of our trip.

1895
02:14:10,882 --> 02:14:13,214
This could be the last
experience of our life!

1896
02:14:13,632 --> 02:14:15,839
Stop it, Arjun.
Let's grab a bite.

1897
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:16,297
Come on.

1898
02:14:17,382 --> 02:14:18,464
- Excuse me.
- Dude are you...

1899
02:14:18,465 --> 02:14:19,756
- I'm starving!

1900
02:14:21,257 --> 02:14:22,882
This is not an adventure sport.

1901
02:14:23,466 --> 02:14:24,840
I object, Judge sahab!

1902
02:14:25,383 --> 02:14:27,591
I agree it's not as
safe as regular sports.

1903
02:14:27,592 --> 02:14:29,049
And is illegal in some countries.

1904
02:14:29,050 --> 02:14:32,049
But according to the Spanish
tradition and cuIture...

1905
02:14:32,134 --> 02:14:33,049
it is allowed.

1906
02:14:33,050 --> 02:14:35,049
And technically,
according to our deal...

1907
02:14:35,134 --> 02:14:37,383
we can choose any sport, remember?

1908
02:14:37,800 --> 02:14:39,216
Imran, it's really dangerous, you know.

1909
02:14:39,217 --> 02:14:41,424
Yes, those bulls could kill us, alright?

1910
02:14:41,759 --> 02:14:44,341
We'll be dangling on their horns
like tandoori chicken on skewers!

1911
02:14:44,342 --> 02:14:46,049
Precisely the point.

1912
02:14:47,175 --> 02:14:49,258
You want to get rid of
the fear within you?

1913
02:14:49,592 --> 02:14:51,799
Well then, here's our
deepest fear. Death.

1914
02:14:52,842 --> 02:14:53,883
Let's face it.

1915
02:14:54,384 --> 02:14:55,841
Because beyond this fear...

1916
02:14:55,842 --> 02:14:56,716
lies victory!

1917
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:58,841
Please spare us the tag lines!

1918
02:14:59,134 --> 02:15:01,008
Dude, think about it!

1919
02:15:01,050 --> 02:15:04,841
No training, no instructors.
Just us, my amigos!

1920
02:15:05,509 --> 02:15:07,259
And some bulls running after us.

1921
02:15:07,551 --> 02:15:09,926
If you want to live... just run!

1922
02:15:10,177 --> 02:15:12,385
Laila, do you know any
psychiatrist around here?

1923
02:15:13,136 --> 02:15:15,385
Because our amigo has
completely lost it!

1924
02:15:16,219 --> 02:15:18,218
I'll be at the starting line
at seven tomorrow morning.

1925
02:15:19,052 --> 02:15:21,010
With or without you.

1926
02:15:26,427 --> 02:15:27,926
I have something for you, Imran.

1927
02:15:28,761 --> 02:15:29,551
It's from Nuria.

1928
02:15:29,636 --> 02:15:30,843
Oh..

1929
02:15:33,261 --> 02:15:34,010
It's in Spanish.

1930
02:15:34,969 --> 02:15:36,301
Love has no language.

1931
02:15:37,052 --> 02:15:37,676
So true.

1932
02:15:40,719 --> 02:15:42,135
I think you should buy her something.

1933
02:15:42,927 --> 02:15:43,718
You're absolutely right.

1934
02:15:44,177 --> 02:15:45,885
Guys... shopping on
next stop?

1935
02:15:47,219 --> 02:15:48,885
Count me out, I'm going
back to the hotel.

1936
02:15:50,011 --> 02:15:51,136
Are you alright?

1937
02:15:52,012 --> 02:15:53,095
Hey.

1938
02:15:53,388 --> 02:15:54,178
I'm fine.

1939
02:15:55,013 --> 02:15:56,970
That we'll only know after a test.

1940
02:15:58,054 --> 02:15:58,803
Test?

1941
02:16:00,096 --> 02:16:01,137
What do you say, Dr. Fraud?

1942
02:16:02,013 --> 02:16:02,887
Are you game?

1943
02:16:03,388 --> 02:16:04,053
Bring it on.

1944
02:16:04,888 --> 02:16:05,970
You have to say the first thing --

1945
02:16:05,971 --> 02:16:08,178
I know the drill. Ask!

1946
02:16:09,054 --> 02:16:09,720
Black.

1947
02:16:10,013 --> 02:16:10,470
Night.

1948
02:16:10,554 --> 02:16:11,387
Sea.

1949
02:16:11,596 --> 02:16:12,262
SaIty.

1950
02:16:12,346 --> 02:16:13,137
Work.

1951
02:16:13,138 --> 02:16:14,137
Money.

1952
02:16:14,138 --> 02:16:14,970
Sex.

1953
02:16:15,221 --> 02:16:16,012
I like!

1954
02:16:16,013 --> 02:16:16,678
Friend.

1955
02:16:17,138 --> 02:16:17,803
You.

1956
02:16:18,054 --> 02:16:19,053
Marriage.

1957
02:16:20,221 --> 02:16:21,387
Family.

1958
02:16:28,221 --> 02:16:29,012
What?

1959
02:16:31,013 --> 02:16:32,387
Is that all?

1960
02:16:32,388 --> 02:16:33,763
It was enough.

1961
02:16:35,597 --> 02:16:37,180
Smartass...

1962
02:16:37,181 --> 02:16:41,055
You're using my trick on me?
Just say what you want to.

1963
02:16:41,473 --> 02:16:42,347
Okay.

1964
02:16:43,015 --> 02:16:45,514
You hesitated on 'marriage'.

1965
02:16:46,056 --> 02:16:47,305
So?

1966
02:16:47,390 --> 02:16:50,972
I'm just saying... you
hesitated... on marriage.

1967
02:16:54,973 --> 02:16:55,805
Look...

1968
02:16:56,806 --> 02:17:00,180
I don't have the time for
this crap. See you later.

1969
02:17:04,181 --> 02:17:06,722
- Okay.
- I'm sorry, I'm going to...

1970
02:17:14,598 --> 02:17:15,555
Kabir.

1971
02:17:20,724 --> 02:17:21,473
Go!

1972
02:17:24,350 --> 02:17:25,516
Kabir!

1973
02:17:26,558 --> 02:17:28,141
Kabir... man, just stop!

1974
02:17:28,767 --> 02:17:29,891
What?

1975
02:17:31,058 --> 02:17:32,891
Talk to us man. What's going on?

1976
02:17:33,142 --> 02:17:34,974
It's nothing, really.

1977
02:17:37,183 --> 02:17:38,141
Kabir...

1978
02:17:40,100 --> 02:17:42,224
Look, I'm sorry I lost my cool.

1979
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:46,016
Because I said you have
a problem with marriage?

1980
02:17:46,850 --> 02:17:50,182
I guess, I'm freaking out. I
don't know what's happening.

1981
02:17:50,433 --> 02:17:52,849
It's normal to be nervous.

1982
02:17:52,850 --> 02:17:55,224
It's not like you're having
an arranged marriage.

1983
02:17:55,225 --> 02:17:58,057
Yeah, but she isn't
the same person I met.

1984
02:17:58,684 --> 02:18:00,850
She's changed, she's become possessive.

1985
02:18:01,393 --> 02:18:04,767
The girl I knew was a talented,
independent interior designer.

1986
02:18:04,976 --> 02:18:07,018
She enjoyed her work.

1987
02:18:07,019 --> 02:18:07,976
But now...

1988
02:18:08,435 --> 02:18:10,393
she's bid adieu to her passion and...

1989
02:18:10,685 --> 02:18:12,559
taken over my life.

1990
02:18:13,477 --> 02:18:15,476
Of course, I want a partner but...

1991
02:18:15,477 --> 02:18:17,101
I want my own life too!

1992
02:18:17,477 --> 02:18:21,226
The whole two bodies, one soul
thing I won't be able to handle it.

1993
02:18:32,102 --> 02:18:34,059
- May I ask you something?
- Yes.

1994
02:18:35,227 --> 02:18:37,518
Don't you think you
proposed to her too soon?

1995
02:18:38,185 --> 02:18:40,393
Actually, I didn't even propose.

1996
02:18:40,394 --> 02:18:42,102
- What?

1997
02:18:42,103 --> 02:18:44,269
I'd bought a ring for my
mom as a birthday gift.

1998
02:18:44,603 --> 02:18:48,102
Before giving it, I happened to show
it to Natasha and she thought...

1999
02:18:48,395 --> 02:18:49,977
it was meant for her.

2000
02:18:51,687 --> 02:18:53,311
- Are you crazy?
- What are you doing?

2001
02:18:53,896 --> 02:18:55,645
- What's wrong with him?
- What's wrong with him?

2002
02:19:01,021 --> 02:19:03,228
No wonder this vacation was
so important for you.

2003
02:19:04,146 --> 02:19:04,728
Meaning?

2004
02:19:05,896 --> 02:19:09,145
Basically, you wanted to
hear from someone else that
you shouldn't get married

2005
02:19:09,187 --> 02:19:12,061
And besides us,
who would've told you this.

2006
02:19:12,062 --> 02:19:13,895
Have you totally lost it?

2007
02:19:13,896 --> 02:19:16,478
The invites are printed. This
isn't the time to overreact!

2008
02:19:17,437 --> 02:19:18,395
Kabir.

2009
02:19:20,062 --> 02:19:21,645
We know Natasha is a great girl.

2010
02:19:21,979 --> 02:19:23,937
And we know you like her.

2011
02:19:24,355 --> 02:19:25,979
And of course, you
don't want to hurt her.

2012
02:19:27,022 --> 02:19:29,979
But ask yourseIf -- Do you
really want to marry her?

2013
02:19:30,647 --> 02:19:32,229
And if not, be honest.

2014
02:19:32,313 --> 02:19:33,937
To yourseIf and to her.

2015
02:19:34,563 --> 02:19:37,438
Of course, she'll be hurt. But in the
long run its best for both of you.

2016
02:19:37,648 --> 02:19:39,188
He is absolutely right, Kabir.

2017
02:19:39,564 --> 02:19:41,272
But I've made a commitment.

2018
02:19:41,773 --> 02:19:43,438
Okay, you screwed up.

2019
02:19:43,439 --> 02:19:45,438
No one's going to send you to prison.

2020
02:19:45,564 --> 02:19:48,022
It's not that simple.
Our parents are involved.

2021
02:19:48,273 --> 02:19:49,063
Parents?

2022
02:19:49,606 --> 02:19:50,772
Dude, it's your life.

2023
02:19:53,856 --> 02:19:55,022
You won't get it.

2024
02:19:56,231 --> 02:19:57,022
Just...

2025
02:19:57,856 --> 02:20:00,063
Just let it be, okay?
I'm sorry.

2026
02:20:00,856 --> 02:20:02,022
Kabir...

2027
02:20:05,731 --> 02:20:06,689
What a guy!

2028
02:20:25,025 --> 02:20:26,065
Laila?

2029
02:20:29,983 --> 02:20:31,024
Why're you shouting?

2030
02:20:32,108 --> 02:20:33,649
Why are you so far?

2031
02:20:48,025 --> 02:20:48,900
Better?

2032
02:20:50,067 --> 02:20:51,108
Best.

2033
02:20:54,192 --> 02:20:54,858
Ammi?

2034
02:20:56,026 --> 02:20:57,358
How are you?

2035
02:21:00,234 --> 02:21:02,191
I met Salman.

2036
02:21:08,652 --> 02:21:11,692
I now know why you and
Abu kept this from me.

2037
02:21:15,193 --> 02:21:16,276
I'm sorry, Ammi.

2038
02:21:19,235 --> 02:21:20,276
- I love you.

2039
02:21:22,027 --> 02:21:23,651
I love you too, my boy.

2040
02:23:44,075 --> 02:23:47,158
The first rocket indicates that
the pen gates have been opened.

2041
02:23:47,409 --> 02:23:49,991
Second rocket indicates that
the bulls are coming towards us.

2042
02:23:50,159 --> 02:23:52,033
We run at the second rocket.

2043
02:23:52,034 --> 02:23:52,866
Second rocket.

2044
02:23:54,409 --> 02:23:56,116
Oh San Fermin, please protect us.

2045
02:23:58,034 --> 02:23:59,199
If I die...

2046
02:23:59,659 --> 02:24:01,324
my spirit will come back to haunt you.

2047
02:24:01,867 --> 02:24:03,283
Why are you thinking about death?

2048
02:24:03,367 --> 02:24:05,324
Think about what you'll do
if you survive.

2049
02:24:10,076 --> 02:24:10,409
Listen...

2050
02:24:11,035 --> 02:24:12,159
a new pact.

2051
02:24:12,993 --> 02:24:14,617
An if-l-get out-alive pact.

2052
02:24:14,701 --> 02:24:15,742
Yeah.

2053
02:24:15,826 --> 02:24:18,284
If I get out alive,
I'll let you read my poetry.

2054
02:24:19,493 --> 02:24:21,117
Why just you?
I'll just...

2055
02:24:21,118 --> 02:24:22,118
get it published.

2056
02:24:23,202 --> 02:24:24,160
You write poetry?

2057
02:24:24,202 --> 02:24:24,993
Yes.

2058
02:24:26,994 --> 02:24:27,951
Okay.

2059
02:24:28,077 --> 02:24:30,118
If I get out alive...

2060
02:24:33,202 --> 02:24:33,826
Okay!

2061
02:24:34,161 --> 02:24:36,201
If I get out alive...

2062
02:24:36,202 --> 02:24:37,993
I'll go to Morocco with Laila.

2063
02:24:37,994 --> 02:24:39,035
Yeah!

2064
02:24:39,244 --> 02:24:40,243
That's what I'll do.

2065
02:24:40,786 --> 02:24:42,993
What's the worst that could
happen? I'll get fired.

2066
02:24:42,994 --> 02:24:43,993
- Right?
- Yeah.

2067
02:24:43,994 --> 02:24:44,993
Who cares man?

2068
02:24:44,994 --> 02:24:46,243
I'll be with her and I will live.

2069
02:24:46,702 --> 02:24:47,910
Well done, my bro!

2070
02:24:48,911 --> 02:24:49,701
Come on, Kabir.

2071
02:24:52,203 --> 02:24:52,786
Okay.

2072
02:24:52,787 --> 02:24:54,411
If I get out alive...

2073
02:24:58,578 --> 02:25:00,036
Shit guys!
The gates are open!

2074
02:25:00,453 --> 02:25:01,536
Kabir just say it.

2075
02:25:01,620 --> 02:25:03,244
It's okay, just say it.

2076
02:25:10,579 --> 02:25:13,412
If I get out alive, I'll go to London...

2077
02:25:13,413 --> 02:25:15,037
and tell Natasha that...

2078
02:25:25,079 --> 02:25:26,328
Say what? Just say it!

2079
02:25:26,663 --> 02:25:27,953
Come on, Kabir!

2080
02:25:31,913 --> 02:25:33,787
- Come on, Kabir!
- Come on!

2081
02:25:33,871 --> 02:25:36,371
I'm sorry but I can't marry you.

2082
02:25:38,622 --> 02:25:40,496
- Congratulations!
- Look out!

2083
02:28:23,212 --> 02:28:25,836
If you're carrying your
restlessness in your heart...

2084
02:28:25,837 --> 02:28:27,920
You are alive.

2085
02:28:28,004 --> 02:28:30,461
If you're carrying the lighting
of dreams in your eyes...

2086
02:28:30,546 --> 02:28:31,795
You are alive.

2087
02:28:33,212 --> 02:28:36,171
Like a gust of wind, learn to live free.

2088
02:28:36,798 --> 02:28:39,755
Learn to flow like the
waves that make a sea.

2089
02:28:40,298 --> 02:28:43,463
Let your arms be wide open,
to every moment you meet.

2090
02:28:44,089 --> 02:28:47,713
May every moment gift
you a new sight to greet.

2091
02:28:48,214 --> 02:28:50,713
If you're carrying your
wonder in your eyes...

2092
02:28:50,798 --> 02:28:52,630
You are alive.

2093
02:28:53,256 --> 02:28:56,255
If you're carrying your
restlessness in your heart...

2094
02:28:57,464 --> 02:28:58,797
You are alive.
